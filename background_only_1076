TI  - A comparison between computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and
      laser scanning for capturing 3-dimensional data from an object of standard form.
PG  - 405-13
AB  - PURPOSE: The study's aim was to compare dimensional measurements on computer
      images generated from data captured digitally by 3 different methods of the
      surfaces of a plastic cube of known form to those obtained directly from the cube
      itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional images were reconstructed of a
      plastic cube obtained by computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), and laser scanning. Digital calipers were used to record dimensional
      measurements between the opposing faces of the plastic cube. Similar dimensional 
      measurements were recorded between the cube faces on each of the reconstructed
      images. The data were analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA to determine whether there
      were differences between dimensional measurements on the computer images
      generated from the digitization of the cube surfaces by the different techniques,
      and the direct measurement of the cube itself. RESULTS: A significant effect of
      how the measurements were taken (ie, direct, CT, MRI, and laser scanning) on the 
      overall variation of dimensional measurement (P < .0005) was observed. Post hoc
      tests (Bonferroni) revealed that these differences were due principally to
      differences between the laser-scanned images compared to other sources (ie,
      direct, CT, and MRI). The magnitude of these differences was very small, up to a 
      maximum mean difference of 0.71 mm (Cl +/- 0.037 mm). CONCLUSION: All 3 methods
      of imaging would be of value in further studies, not only for the fabrication of 
      complex shapes such as prosthetic ears, but also for other facial prostheses.

AB  - The present study examined whether vascular function, expression and activity of 
      NADPH oxidases differ between sexes in porcine isolated coronary arteries (PCAs) 
      using selective Nox inhibitors, ML-171 and VAS2870. Vascular responses of distal 
      PCAs were examined under myographic conditions in the presence of a range of
      inhibitors. Nox activity in PCA homogenates was assessed using lucigenin-enhanced
      chemiluminescence. Protein expression of Nox1, Nox2 and Nox4 was compared using
      Western immunoblotting. The presence of ML-171 or DPI had no effect on the
      bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation in PCAs from females. In males, DPI shifted the
      EC50 2.8-fold to the right. In the presence of L-NAME and indomethacin, DPI and
      ML-171 had no effect in females, but enhanced the bradykinin-induced
      vasorelaxation in males. ML-171 had no effect on the forskolin-induced
      vasorelaxation but decreased the potency of U46619-induced tone in both sexes in 
      the absence or presence of endothelium. VAS2870 had no effect on the
      bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation in both sexes but reduces the EDH-type response
      in males only. Nox activity was reduced by DPI and ML-171, but not VAS2870 in
      PCAs from both sexes. Protein expression of Nox1 and Nox2 in PCAs was higher in
      males compared to females whereas Nox4 was higher in females. Inhibition of Nox
      with ML-171 enhances while VAS2870 reduces the EDH-type response in PCAs from
      males but not females. This indicates that Nox-generated ROS play a role in the
      EDH-type response in males with differences attributed to the differential
      expression of Nox isoforms. This may underlie the greater oxidative stress
      observed in males.

TI  - Disruption of PLZP in mice leads to increased T-lymphocyte proliferation,
      cytokine production, and altered hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.
PG  - 10456-69
AB  - Deregulated function of members of the POK (POZ and Kruppel) family of
      transcriptional repressors, such as promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and
      B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute
      promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. PLZP, also
      known as TZFP, FAZF, or ROG, is a novel POK protein that displays strong homology
      with PLZF and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the cancer-predisposing 
      syndrome, Fanconi's anemia, and of APL, in view of its ability to heterodimerize 
      with the FANC-C and PLZF proteins, respectively. Here we report the generation
      and characterization of mice in which we have specifically inactivated the PLZP
      gene through in-frame insertion of a lacZ reporter and without perturbing the
      expression of the neighboring MLL2 gene. We show that PLZP-deficient mice display
      defects in cell cycle control and cytokine production in the T-cell compartment. 
      Importantly, PLZP inactivation perturbs the homeostasis of the hematopoietic stem
      and/or progenitor cell. On the basis of our data, a deregulation of PLZP function
      in Fanconi's anemia and APL may affect the biology of the hematopoietic stem
      cell, in turn contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders.

PG  - 481-95
LID - 10.1080/10826080701208111 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to assess alcohol use and alcohol consumption-related problems
      in different sociodemographic groups in a rural district in Vietnam. Interviews
      were completed between March 2004 and July 2004. The Alcohol Use Disorder
      Identification Test (AUDIT) was applied to interview 3423 people, who were
      randomly selected in a rural district (1695 men and 1728 women). People who had
      an AUDIT score greater than 7 (in men) or greater than 5 (in women) were
      identified as having alcohol consumption-related problems. Prevalences and
      adjusted odds ratios of alcohol use and alcohol consumption-related problems were
      estimated for different subgroups of the population. Weekly and daily "binge
      drinking" among men were 5.7 and 3.6%, while binge drinking in women was
      virtually nonexistent. The prevalence of alcohol consumption-related problems was
      25.5% among men and 0.7% among women. The differences between sociodemographic
      groups were not strong, but women who were separated, divorced, or widowed as
      well as those with higher education had significantly higher rates of alcohol
      consumption-related problems than married women and those with lower education.
      This study indicates an urgent need for alcohol intervention programs focused on 
      men. However, further monitoring of alcohol use and problems among women is
      important to follow-up changes in consumption pattern. The study's limitations
      are discussed.

      naproxen. A randomized study in 86 patients with intravenous on-demand analgesia 
      after orthopaedic surgery.].
PG  - 167-73
AB  - In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 86 patients (44 verum,
      42 placebo), scheduled for knee-joint arthrotomies or minor orthopaedic
      operations received either naproxen, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory analgesic,
      or placebo orally in three doses: the first immediately before the operation and 
      the others 6 h and 12 h after the first. The verum group received 1250 mg
      naproxen in total. Postoperative pain intensity was measured by the category
      splitting procedure. All patients were allowed to self-administer piritramide
      from a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) pump (Prominjekt, Pharmacia, Sweden) in
      2-mg boluses every 5 min during a 6-h period and subsequently every 15 min for
      another 18 h after surgery. The patients receiving verum had significantly
      (P<0.05) less pain immediately after surgery and used a significantly lower
      cumulated dose of piritramide during the first 24 h after operation (24 mg vs 44 
      mg;P<0.05) than placebo-treated subjects. There were no significant differences
      in the incidence of side-effects between the two groups. The intensity of typical
      side effects of opioids and antipyretic anti-inflammatory analgesics (nausea,
      vomiting, stomachache, headache, vertigo) was low and they were easily controlled
      in all cases. Lowering of respiratory frequency was not observed. Perioperative
      administration of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic naproxen results
      in better pain relief and significantly lower opioid requirements (by about 46%) 
      after minor orthopaedic surgery.

TI  - Complications, recurrences, early and late reoperations after stapled
      haemorrhoidopexy: lessons learned from 1,233 cases.
PG  - 1049-54
LID - 10.1007/s00423-009-0543-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to analyse the outcomes of all patients
      requiring a reoperation after an initial circular stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH)
      for prolapsing haemorrhoids. METHODS: Data of all patients undergoing a circular 
      SH from 1998 thru 2007 available in a prospectively collected database were
      reviewed, and all patients who had reoperations were studied. RESULTS: During the
      study period, 1,233 patients (551 females, median age 52 years) underwent a
      circular SH. Complete follow-up was available in all patients (median follow-up 7
      months, range 0.5-100); 127 patients (10.3%) required one or more reoperations.
      Early reoperations (<30 days) were necessary in 47 patients (3.8%), and 45 (3.6%)
      were stapler-related complications. Late reoperations (>30 days) were performed
      in 84 patients (6.8%) and 57 (4.6%) were stapler-related. A learning curve was
      observed with significant reduction of early (<30 days) and late (>30 days)
      reoperation rate with time. CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations after SH are necessary in
      about 10% of the patients. The majority of the reoperations are due to either
      complications arising from circular SH, recurrent/persistent haemorrhoidal
      symptoms or other anorectal issues not addressed by the circular SH procedure
      (3.8% early; 6.8% late). Circular SH appears to be an effective procedure for
      symptomatic haemorrhoidal disease; however, training and learning curve issues
      should be addressed to minimise treatment failures.

TI  - WNT10A exonic variant increases the risk of keratoconus by decreasing corneal
      thickness.
PG  - 5060-8
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv211 [doi]
AB  - Keratoconus is a degenerative eye condition which results from thinning of the
      cornea and causes vision distortion. Treatments such as ultraviolet (UV)
      cross-linking have proved effective for management of keratoconus when performed 
      in early stages of the disease. The central corneal thickness (CCT) is a highly
      heritable endophenotype of keratoconus, and it is estimated that up to 95% of its
      phenotypic variance is due to genetics. Genome-wide association efforts of CCT
      have identified common variants (i.e. minor allele frequency (MAF) >5%). However,
      these studies typically ignore the large set of exonic variants whose MAF is
      usually low. In this study, we performed a CCT exome-wide association analysis in
      a sample of 1029 individuals from a population-based study in Western Australia. 
      We identified a genome-wide significant exonic variant rs121908120 (P = 6.63 x
      10(-10)) in WNT10A. This gene is 437 kb from a gene previously associated with
      CCT (USP37). We showed in a conditional analysis that the WNT10A variant
      completely accounts for the signal previously seen at USP37. We replicated our
      finding in independent samples from the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study, Twin Eye 
      Study in Tasmania and the Rotterdam Study. Further, we genotyped rs121908120 in
      621 keratoconus cases and compared the frequency to a sample of 1680 unscreened
      controls from the Queensland Twin Registry. We found that rs121908120 increases
      the risk of keratoconus two times (odds ratio 2.03, P = 5.41 x 10(-5)).

TI  - Aggregating embryonic but not somatic nuclear transfer embryos increases cloning 
      efficiency in cattle.
PG  - 268-78
AB  - Our objectives were to compare the cellular and molecular effects of aggregating 
      bovine embryonic vs. somatic cell nuclear transfer (ECNT vs. SCNT) embryos and to
      determine whether aggregation can improve cattle cloning efficiency. We
      reconstructed cloned embryos from: 1) morula-derived blastomeres, 2) six adult
      male ear skin fibroblast lines, 3) one fetal female lung fibroblast line (BFF),
      and 4) two transgenic clonal strains derived from BFF. Embryos were cultured
      either singularly (1X) or as aggregates of three (3X). In vitro-fertilized (IVF) 
      1X and 3X embryos served as controls. After aggregation, the in vitro development
      of ECNT but not that of SCNT or IVF embryos was strongly compromised. The inner
      cell mass (ICM), total cell (TC) numbers, and ICM:TC ratios significantly
      increased for all the aggregates. The relative concentration of the key embryonic
      transcript POU5F1 (or OCT4) did not correlate with these increases, remaining
      unchanged in the ECNT and IVF aggregates and decreasing significantly in the SCNT
      aggregates. Overall, the IVF and 3X ECNT but not the 1X ECNT embryos had
      significantly higher relative POU5F1 levels than the SCNT embryos. High POU5F1
      levels correlated with high in vivo survival, while no such correlation was noted
      for the ICM:TC ratios. Development to weaning was more than doubled in the ECNT
      aggregates (10/51 or 20% vs. 7/85 or 8% for 3X vs. 1X, respectively; P < 0.05).
      In contrast, the SCNT and IVF controls showed no improvement in survival. These
      data reveal striking biological differences between embryonic and somatic clones 
      in response to aggregation.

TI  - Syme and his amputation.
PG  - 91-8
AB  - The study examines Syme's indications for and technique of amputation at the
      ankle and reviews the outcome of cases operated on by him for the years
      1841-1866. Sources are the Ward Journals and the General Registers of Patients of
      the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh for the period under review together with
      abstracts from contemporary medical journals and surgical textbooks. Ninety-eight
      cases are included in the study, of which 87 survived and 11 died in the
      post-operative period. The principal indication for this amputation was 'caries' 
      and the nature of this disorder is outlined. Syme's operative technique is
      described together with variations recommended by other contemporary surgeons.
      Syme introduced amputation at the ankle joint with the object of reducing
      mortality and providing a better stump in cases of disease and injury to the
      foot. The figures from this study conclude that he was justified on both counts.

TI  - Thiol switches in redox regulation of chloroplasts: balancing redox state,
      metabolism and oxidative stress.

AB  - In photosynthesizing chloroplasts, rapidly changing energy input, intermediate
      generation of strong reductants as well as oxidants and multiple participating
      physicochemical processes and pathways, call for efficient regulation. Coupling
      redox information to protein function via thiol modifications offers a powerful
      mechanism to activate, down-regulate and coordinate interdependent processes.
      Efficient thiol switching of target proteins involves the thiol-disulfide redox
      regulatory network, which is highly elaborated in chloroplasts. This review
      addresses the features of this network. Its conditional function depends on
      specificity of reduction and oxidation reactions and pathways, thiol redox
      buffering, but also formation of heterogeneous milieus by microdomains,
      metabolite gradients and macromolecular assemblies. One major player is
      glutathione. Its synthesis and function is under feedback redox control. The
      number of thiol-controlled processes and involved thiol switched proteins is
      steadily increasing, e.g., in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, plastid transcription
      and plastid translation. Thus chloroplasts utilize an intricate and versatile
      redox regulatory network for intraorganellar and retrograde communication.

TI  - Incidence of Hospitalized Stroke in the Czech Republic: The National Registry of 
      Hospitalized Patients.

LID - S1052-3057(16)30454-2 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemporary stroke incidence data are not available in some
      countries and regions, including in Eastern Europe. Based on previous validation 
      of the accuracy of the National Registry of Hospitalized Patients (NRHOSP), we
      report the incidence of hospitalized stroke in the Czech Republic (CR) using the 
      NRHOSP. METHODS: The results of the prior validation study assessing the accuracy
      of coding of stroke diagnoses in the NRHOSP were applied, and we calculated (1)
      the overall incidence of hospitalized stroke and (2) the incidence rates of
      hospitalized stroke for the three main stroke types: cerebral infarction
      (International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, CI I63), subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (SAH I60), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH I61). We calculated the
      average annual age- and sex-standardized incidence. RESULTS: The overall
      incidence of hospitalized stroke was 241 out of 100,000 individuals. The
      incidence of hospitalized stroke for the main stroke types was 8.2 cases in SAH, 
      29.5 in ICH, and 211 in CI per 100,000 individuals. The standardized annual
      stroke incidence adjusted to the 2000 World Health Organization population for
      overall stroke incidence of hospitalized stroke was 131 per 100,000 individuals. 
      Standardized stroke incidence for stroke subtypes was 5.7 cases in SAH, 16.7 in
      ICH, and 113 in CI per 100,000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide an
      initial assessment of the burden of stroke in this part of the world. The
      estimates of hospitalized stroke in the CR and Eastern Europe suggest that ICH is
      about three times more common than SAH, and hemorrhagic stroke makes up about 18%
      of strokes.

AB  - Capital needs during the next twenty years for public wastewater treatment,
      piping, combined sewer overflow correction, and storm-water management are
      estimated to be approximately $300 billion for the USA. Financing these needs is 
      a significant challenge, as Federal funding for the Clean Water Act has been
      reduced by 70% during the last twenty years. There is an urgent need for new
      approaches to assist states and other decision makers to prioritize wastewater
      maintenance and improvements. We present a methodology for performing an
      integrated quantitative watershed-scale goals assessment for sustaining
      wastewater infrastructure. We applied this methodology to ten watersheds of the
      Hudson-Mohawk basin in New York State, USA that together are home to more than
      2.7 million people, cover 3.5 million hectares, and contain more than 36,000 km
      of streams. We assembled data on 183 POTWs treating approximately 1.5 million
      m(3) of wastewater per day. For each watershed, we analyzed eight metrics: Growth
      Capacity, Capacity Density, Soil Suitability, Violations, Tributary Length
      Impacted, Tributary Capital Cost, Volume Capital Cost, and Population Capital
      Cost. These metrics were integrated into three goals for watershed-scale
      management: Tributary Protection, Urban Development, and Urban-Rural Integration.
      Our results demonstrate that the methodology can be implemented using widely
      available data, although some verification of data is required. Furthermore, we
      demonstrate substantial differences in character, need, and the appropriateness
      of different management strategies among the ten watersheds. These results
      suggest that it is feasible to perform watershed-scale goals assessment to
      augment existing approaches to wastewater infrastructure analysis and planning.

TI  - The measurement of disability weights for 18 prevalent acute poisoning
      conditions.
PG  - 1033-40
LID - 10.1177/0960327115617229 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disability weights (DWs) are used in disease burden studies, with the
      calculation of the weight of the disability as years lived with disability versus
      years of lost life accounting for mortalities. Currently, there is a single DW
      score available for poisoning, which is considered to be a single health state.
      This makes it difficult to evaluate the differing burdens of poisonings involving
      various substances/conditions in comparison with other health states in countries
      with different patterns of substance abuse. The aim of this study is therefore to
      estimate the DWs of 18 common poisonings based on the expert elicitation method. 
      METHODS: A panel of 10 medical clinicians who were familiar with the clinical
      aspects of different poisonings estimated the DWs of 50 health states by
      interpolating them on a calibrated Visual Analogue Scale. The DWs of some
      poisonings, such as alcohol, cannabis and heroin, had been estimated in previous 
      studies and so were used to determine the external consistency of our panel. As a
      matter of routine, the DWs could vary on a scale between 0 (best health state)
      and 1 (worst health state). RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that both the
      internal (Cronbach's alpha = 0.912) and external consistency of the panel were
      acceptable. The DWs for the different poisonings were estimated along a range
      from 0.830 for severe aluminium phosphide to 0.022 for mild benzodiazepine.
      CONCLUSIONS: Different poisonings should be weighted differently since they vary 
      widely. Unfortunately, they are currently all weighted the same.

TI  - Incidence and clinical characteristics of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine
      tumor in Korea: a single-center experience.
PG  - 452-458
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2015.232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may originate from heterogeneous
      neuroendocrine cells. The incidence is increasing worldwide, and World Health
      Organization (WHO) updated its classification in 2010. We investigated clinical
      characteristics of gastroenteropancreatic NETs in a single center. METHODS:
      Clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with pathologically confirmed
      gastroenteropancreatic NET in Seoul St. Mary Hospital from March 2009 to August
      2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The grade and stage were determined according
      to WHO 2010 classification and TNM Staging System for Neuroendocrine Tumors (7th 
      ed., 2010) of American Joint Committee on Cancer. RESULTS: One hundred and
      twenty-five patients (median age, 50; male, 61.3%) were analyzed. Among 100,000
      patients who visited the hospital, incidence was 24.1. Only two patients (1.6%)
      had a functional NET. The rectum (n = 99, 79.8%) was most common primary site and
      found in early stage. The prevalence by stages was 84.7% stage I, 8.9% stage IV, 
      4.8% stage II, and 1.6% stage III. The pathology grading was 74.5% grade 1, 12.7%
      grade 2, and 12.7% grade 3. Tumor stage correlated positively with pathologic
      grade (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, 0.644). CONCLUSIONS: Wide range
      of clinicopathological features of Korean gastroenteropancreatic NETs were
      demonstrated using WHO 2010 classification. Rectal NET was most frequent and
      found in early stage.

TI  - Profermin is efficacious in patients with active ulcerative colitis--a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 2584-92
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437046.26036.db [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Profermin is developed for the dietary management of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). It consists of water, fermented oats, barley malt, lecithin, and
      Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical
      efficacy of Profermin. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with a mild-to-moderate
      flare-up of UC (defined as Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI] score
      >/=5 and </=11) were randomly assigned to Profermin (n = 32) or Fresubin (n =
      41). The primary endpoint was to assess whether addition of Profermin in UC could
      significantly reduce SCCAI in comparison with Fresubin. RESULTS: In the run-in
      period, the mean SCCAI was 7.2 +/- 1.50 in the Profermin group and 7.6 +/- 1.47
      in the Fresubin group (not significant). After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean
      reduction of SCCAI score was higher in the Profermin group (mean difference:
      -1.77 SCCAI, 95% confidence interval -2.97 to -0.55; P < 0.005), in
      intention-to-treat analyses. Remission defined as SCCAI </=2.5 was achieved in 10
      of 32 (31%) in the Profermin group and in 6 of 41 (15%) in the Fresubin group (P 
      = 0.048). The decrease in SCCAI scores of >/=50% was higher in the Profermin
      group 17 of 32 (53%) versus 11 of 41 (27%) (P = 0.04). The risk of dropping out
      due to treatment failure/lack of effect was higher in the Fresubin group (42%
      versus 13%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with Profermin is safe, well 
      tolerated, palatable, and able to reduce SCCAI scores at a statistically and
      clinically significant level in patients with mild-to-moderate UC with a
      flare-up.

TI  - Susceptibility to deltamethrin of wild and domestic populations of Triatoma
      infestans of the Gran Chaco and the Inter-Andean Valleys of Bolivia.
PG  - 497
LID - 10.1186/s13071-014-0497-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The persistence of Triatoma infestans and the continuous transmission
      of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Inter-Andean Valleys and in the Gran Chaco of Bolivia
      are of great significance. Coincidentally, it is in these regions the reach of
      the vector control strategies is limited, and reports of T. infestans resistance 
      to insecticides, including in wild populations, have been issued. This study aims
      to characterize the susceptibility to deltamethrin of wild and domestic
      populations of T. infestans from Bolivia, in order to better understand the
      extent of this relevant problem. METHODS: Susceptibility to deltamethrin was
      assessed in nine, wild and domestic, populations of T. infestans from the Gran
      Chaco and the Inter-Andean Valleys of Bolivia. Serial dilutions of deltamethrin
      in acetone (0.2 muL) were topically applied in first instar nymphs (F1, five days
      old, fasting, weight 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg). Dose response results were analyzed with
      PROBIT version 2, determining the lethal doses, slope and resistance ratios (RR).
      Qualitative tests were also performed. RESULTS: Three wild T. infestans dark
      morph samples of Chaco from the Santa Cruz Department were susceptible to
      deltamethrin with RR50 of <2, and 100% mortality to the diagnostic dose (DD);
      however, two domestic populations from the same region were less susceptible than
      the susceptibility reference lineage (RR50 of 4.21 and 5.04 respectively and 93% 
      DD). The domestic population of Villa Montes from the Chaco of the Tarija
      Department presented high levels of resistance (RR50 of 129.12 and 0% DD).
      Moreover, the domestic populations from the Valleys of the Cochabamba Department 
      presented resistance (RR50 of 8.49 and 62% DD), the wild populations were less
      susceptible than SRL and T. infestans dark morph populations (RR50 < 5).
      CONCLUSION: The elimination of T. infestans with pyrethroid insecticides in
      Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and its drastic reduction in large parts of Paraguay and 
      Argentina, clearly indicates that pyrethroid resistance was very uncommon in
      non-Andean regions. The pyrethroid susceptibility of non-Andean T. infestans dark
      morph population, and the resistance towards it, of Andean T. infestans wild and 
      domestic populations, indicates that the Andean populations from Bolivia are less
      susceptible.

TI  - A pilot study of EUS-guided fiducial insertion for the multidisciplinary
      management of gastric cancer.
PG  - E153-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1377523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The 5-year survival rates for gastric cancer remain
      poor despite evolving therapies, and fiducial insertion via endoscopic ultrasound
      (EUS) is novel within this setting. We aimed to assess the feasibility of
      fiducial insertion for response assessment and anatomic localization in patients 
      with gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective phase II feasibility
      study was undertaken at Austin Health (Victoria, Australia) from February 2011 to
      November 2012. Consecutive adult patients were enrolled who had primary
      adenocarcinoma of the stomach with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage T1 - 
      3,N0 - 1,M0 - 1a and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
      0 or 1. In addition, the patients were medically suitable for gastrectomy and
      chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy. Gold fiducial markers were inserted under EUS
      guidance into the margins of the gastric cancer primary. The main outcome was
      successful insertion of the fiducial without complications for response
      assessment and anatomic localization. RESULTS: A total of 15 fiducials were
      successfully inserted into 7 (88 %) of 8 patients. No immediate or delayed
      complications were noted. One patient proceeded to image-guided radiotherapy
      through the use of fiducials and is disease free at 12 months. Fiducials were
      used to assess treatment response in all patients who underwent computed
      tomographic imaging after insertion. Follow-up computed tomography with fiducial 
      placement improved anatomic localization and estimation of the gastric cancer
      primary size in 3 (60 %) of 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of
      our small study cohort, fiducials were placed in gastric cancers under EUS
      guidance without complications, and placement was successful in the majority of
      our patients. Although potential benefits exist, there remain substantial
      limitations to the generalization of this technique across our patient
      population.

PG  - 243-7
LID - 10.1080/01676830802224668 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the pattern of bacteriology of chronic dacryocystitis in
      the Northeast Indian population and compare it with previous studies. METHODS: A 
      prospective analysis of 543 lacrimal sac content of 421 patients in the period of
      October 2003 to June 2007. Material obtained directly from the lacrimal sac
      during making sac flap that had undergone external dacryocystorhinostomy for
      chronic dacryocystitis. RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-four bacteria were isolated 
      from 543 specimens of 421 patients. Growths were observed in 494 (90.97%)
      specimens, and there was no growth in 49 (9.03%) of the specimens; 61.04% were
      female and 38.95% were male. Four hundred ninety-four samples (90.97%) were
      positive for bacteria, including both single and mixed isolations. Four hundred
      five (74.58%) had single isolations, 89 (16.39%) patients had mixed bacterial
      isolations (more than one organism), and no organisms were isolated from 49
      (9.02%) specimens. The majority of microorganisms in our study were gram-positive
      bacteria, 75% of the overall microorganisms cultured were gram-positive bacteria,
      with a predominance of staphylococcus species. Gram-negative bacteria were
      isolated in 25% of the specimens with predominance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
      CONCLUSIONS: It is important to have knowledge of the microbial organisms
      responsible for chronic dacryocystitis in a particular geographical area to
      choose the prophylactic antibiotic following lacrimal drainage procedure.
      Identification of the microbes and proper antibiotic prophylaxis helps for the
      better management of the postoperative period.

TI  - Computational exploration of the reaction mechanism of the Cu(+)-catalysed
      synthesis of indoles from N-aryl enaminones.
PG  - 150582
LID - 10.1098/rsos.150582 [doi]
AB  - We have studied the role of Cu(+)-phenantroline as a catalyst in the cyclization 
      of N-aryl-enaminones using density-functional theory computations. The catalyst
      was found to bind the substrate upon deprotonation of its eneaminone, and to
      dramatically increase the acidity of the carbon adjacent to the ketone
      functionality. The deprotonation of this carbon atom yields a carbanion which
      attacks the aryl moiety, thereby closing the heterocycle in the rate-determining 
      step. This C-C bond forming reaction was found to proceed much more rapidly when 
      preceded by re-protonation of the substrate N-atom (which had lost H(+) in the
      initial step). Hydride transfer to the catalyst then completes the indole
      synthesis, in a very fast step. The influence of Li(+) and K(+) on the
      regio-selectivity of the cyclization of bromo-substituted analogues could not,
      however, be reproduced by our model. Alternative pathways involving either
      single-electron transfer from the catalyst to the substrate or ring cyclization
      without previous carbon alpha-deprotonation were found to be kinetically or
      thermodynamically inaccessible.

TI  - Dosimetric impact of orthopedic metal artifact reduction (O-MAR) on Spine SBRT
      patients.
PG  - 106-116
LID - 10.1120/jacmp.v16i5.5356 [doi]
AB  - The dosimetric impact of orthopedic metal artifact reduction (O-MAR) on spine
      SBRT patients has not been comprehensively studied, particularly with spinal
      prostheses in high-dose gradient regions. Using both phantom and patient
      datasets, we investigated dosimetric effects of O-MAR in combination of various
      metal locations and dose calculation algorithms. A physical phantom, with and
      without a titanium insert, was scanned. A clinical patient plan was applied to
      the artifact-free reference, non-O-MAR, and O-MAR phantom images with the
      titanium located either inside or outside of the tumor. Subsequently, five
      clinical patient plans were calculated with pencil beam and Monte Carlo (iPlan)
      on non-O-MAR and O-MAR patient images using an extended CT-density table. The
      dose differences for phantom plans and patient plans were analyzed using dose
      distributions, dose-volume histograms (DVHs), gamma index, and selected
      dosimetric endpoints. From both phantom plans and patient plans, O-MAR did not
      affect dose distributions and DVHs while minimizing metal artifacts. Among
      patient plans, we found that, when the same dose calculation method was used, the
      difference in the dosimetric endpoints between non-O-MAR and O-MAR datasets were 
      small. In conclusion, for spine SBRT patients with spinal prostheses, O-MAR image
      reconstruction does not affect dose calculation accuracy while minimizing metal
      artifacts. Therefore, O-MAR images can be safely used for clinical spine SBRT
      treatment planning.

      steatohepatitis from cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 506-14

AB  - UNLABELLED: Excess hepatic storage of triglycerides is considered a benign
      condition, but nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to fibrosis and
      promote atherosclerosis. Carriers of the TM6SF2 E167K variant have fatty liver as
      a result of reduced secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). As a
      result, they have lower circulating lipids and reduced risk of myocardial
      infarction. In this study, we aimed to assess whether TM6SF2 E167K affects liver 
      damage and cardiovascular outcomes in subjects at risk of NASH. Liver damage was 
      evaluated in 1,201 patients who underwent liver biopsy for suspected NASH; 427
      were evaluated for carotid atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular outcomes were assessed
      in 1,819 controls from the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) cohort. Presence of the
      inherited TM6SF2 E167K variant was determined by TaqMan assays. In the liver
      biopsy cohort, 188 subjects (13%) were carriers of the E167K variant. They had
      lower serum lipid levels than noncarriers (P < 0.05), had more-severe steatosis, 
      necroinflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis (P < 0.05), and were more likely to
      have NASH (odds ratio [OR]: 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-2.79) and
      advanced fibrosis (OR, 2.08; 95% CI: 1.20-3.55), after adjustment for age, sex,
      body mass index, fasting hyperglycemia, and the I148M PNPLA3 risk variant.
      However, E167K carriers had lower risk of developing carotid plaques (OR, 0.49;
      95% CI: 0.25-0.94). In the SOS cohort, E167K carriers had higher alanine
      aminotransferase ALT and lower lipid levels (P < 0.05), as well as a lower
      incidence of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39-0.95).
      CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the TM6SF2 E167K variant are more susceptible to
      progressive NASH, but are protected against cardiovascular disease. Our findings 
      suggest that reduced ability to export VLDLs is deleterious for the liver.

TI  - Landolt ring-shaped epithelial keratopathy: a novel clinical entity of the
      cornea.
PG  - 89-92
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2014.2381 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Landolt ring-shaped epithelial keratopathy is a newly identified
      disease with vesicular changes of unknown origin in the epithelial cells.
      OBSERVATIONS: Eleven Japanese patients with specific epithelial lesions that
      resembled a Landolt ring in the corneal epithelium were assessed. The main
      symptoms of Landolt ring-shaped epithelial keratopathy are foreign-body sensation
      and photophobia. Slitlamp examination indicates that Landolt ring-shaped lesions 
      located only in the corneal epithelium are randomly distributed and occur
      unilaterally, bilaterally, or asymmetrically. Small lesions are sometimes
      connected to each other to form a large Landolt ring in a fractal pattern.
      Confocal microscopy reveals that the Landolt ring lesions are vesicular changes
      in the epithelial cells from the basal cell layer to the superficial cell layer
      without inflammation. The lesions form for weeks to months with sporadic
      exacerbations and natural remissions with or without treatments. The outcomes do 
      not include epithelial disorders in the affected corneas or visual disruptions.
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We describe a new disease entity of unknown origin
      referred to as Landolt ring-shaped epithelial keratopathy, which is usually
      bilateral and characterized by specific Landolt ring-shaped focal epithelial
      lesions with vesicular changes only in the epithelial cells. The disorder has an 
      insidious onset and self-limiting nature despite treatment and should be included
      in the differential diagnosis of corneal epithelial disorders.

TI  - Development of kinomic analyses to identify dysregulated signaling pathways in
      cells expressing cytoplasmic PrP.
PG  - 175
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-11-175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulated protein kinase signaling is involved in the pathogenesis
      of many chronic diseases. However, the dysregulated signaling pathways critical
      to prion pathogenesis remain incompletely characterized. Global analyses of
      signaling pathways may be useful to better characterize these pathways. We
      therefore set out to develop such global assays. To this end, we used as a model 
      cytoplasmic mutants of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), which are toxic to N2a 
      neuroblastoma cells. We tested the global assays for their sensitivity to detect 
      changes in signaling pathways in cells expressing cytoplasmic PrP mutants.
      METHODS: We developed a targeted proteomics (kinomics) approach using multiplex
      Western blots to identify signaling pathways dysregulated in chronic neurological
      pathologies. We tested the approach for its potential ability to detect signaling
      changes in N2a cells expressing cytoplasmic PrP mutants. RESULTS: Multiplex
      Western blots were designed to quantitate the expression levels of 137 protein
      kinases in a single membrane and using only 1.2 mg of sample. The response of the
      blots was sensitive and linear to changes of 6% in protein levels. Hierarchical
      and functional clustering of the relative expression levels identified an mTOR
      signaling pathway as potentially dysregulated in N2a cells expressing cytoplasmic
      PrP. The mTOR signaling pathway regulates global protein synthesis, which is
      inhibited in cells expressing cytoplasmic PrP. The levels of proteins involved in
      the Akt1/p70S6K branch of mTOR signaling changed in synchrony with time of
      cytoplasmic PrP expression. Three kinases in this pathway, Akt, p70S6K, and eIF4B
      were in their inactive states, as evaluated by phosphorylation of their
      regulatory sites. CONCLUSION: The results presented are consistent with the
      previously reported inhibition of Akt/p70S6K/eIF4B signaling as mediating
      pathogenesis of cytoplasmic PrP. We conclude that the kinomic analyses are
      sensitive and specific to detect signaling pathways dysregulated in a simple in
      vitro model of PrP pathogenesis.

TI  - Moving up, down, and everywhere: signaling of micronutrients in plants.
PG  - 320-7
LID - 10.1016/j.pbi.2009.04.006 [doi]
AB  - To cope with the variable availability of micronutrients, plants have evolved a
      complex set of physiological and developmental processes, which are under tight
      control of short-range and long-range signaling pathways. These signals act at
      the cellular and whole-plant scale to coordinate micronutrient homeostasis at the
      systemic and local level. Recently, several molecular components of the local and
      long-distance regulatory circuits as well as their putative positions in the
      signaling cascade have been identified. Since among the micronutrients
      comparatively most is known on the signaling of Fe, this review sets a focus on
      Fe, for which the regulatory pathway most likely involves signaling compounds
      such as nitric oxide and hormones (e.g. ethylene and cytokinin) that act upstream
      of a set of transcription factors.

TI  - Modulatory effects of estrogen and progesterone on colorectal hyperalgesia in the
      rat.
PG  - 433-42
AB  - The contribution of estrogen and progesterone to colorectal hyperalgesia was
      examined in female rats. The electromyogram recorded from the abdominal wall
      (visceromotor response, vmr) and the discharge of lumbosacral dorsal horn neurons
      to colorectal distention (CRD) were measured in intact female, ovariectomized
      (OVx) and estradiol replaced OVx (E2; 50mug, 48h) rats with and without colonic
      inflammation. Colorectal hyperalgesia was transient in intact rats, but persisted
      at least 4h in E2 and OVx rats. The magnitude of hyperalgesia in E2 rats was
      greater than OVx which was greater than intact rats. Dorsal horn neurons that
      responded to CRD with an Abrupt (on and off with stimulus) excitatory discharge
      showed similar sensitivity to estradiol as the vmr following colonic
      inflammation. In contrast, inflammation did not increase the magnitude of
      response of excitatory neurons with sustained afterdischarges in any of the
      treatment groups. Intact female rats have a comparable plasma estrogen
      concentration to E2 rats, suggesting the difference in responses may have been
      due to antinociceptive effects of progesterone. This was tested by administering 
      E2+/- progesterone (1mg) and measuring the vmr. Progesterone reduced the
      facilitation of the vmr produced by E2 before and following colonic inflammation.
      The present study suggests that estrogen replacement enhances visceral signal
      processing following colonic inflammation. Furthermore, progesterone may
      counteract the effects of estrogen on colorectal sensitivity.

TI  - Mechanical stretch induces monocyte chemoattractant activity via an
      NF-kappaB-dependent monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-mediated pathway in human 
      mesangial cells: inhibition by rosiglitazone.
PG  - 688-96
AB  - Hemodynamic abnormalities are important in the pathogenesis of the glomerular
      damage in diabetes. Glomerular macrophage infiltration driven by the chemokine
      monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is an early event in diabetic
      nephropathy. The thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone ameliorates albumin excretion
      rate in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria and has anti-inflammatory
      properties, raising the possibility of a relationship between its renoprotective 
      and anti-inflammatory activity. Investigated was whether mesangial cell
      stretching, mimicking in vitro glomerular capillary hypertension, enhances MCP-1 
      expression and monocyte chemoattractant activity. The effect of the combination
      of stretch with high glucose on MCP-1 production was studied and, finally, the
      effect of rosiglitazone on these processes was assessed. Stretching of human
      mesangial cells significantly enhanced their monocyte chemoattractant activity.
      This effect was mediated by MCP-1 as it was paralleled by a significant rise in
      both MCP-1 mRNA and protein levels and was completely abolished by MCP-1
      blockade. Combined exposure to both stretch and high glucose further increased
      MCP-1 production. Stretch activated the IkappaB-NF-kappaB pathway, and NF-kappaB 
      inhibition, with the use of the specific inhibitor SN50, completely abolished
      stretch-induced MCP-1, indicating that stretch-induced MCP-1 was NF-kappaB
      dependent. The addition of rosiglitazone significantly diminished stretch-induced
      NF-kappaB activation, MCP-1 production, and monocyte chemotaxis. In conclusion,
      stretching of mesangial cells stimulates their monocyte chemoattractant activity 
      via an NF-kappaB-mediated, MCP-1-dependent pathway, and this effect is prevented 
      by rosiglitazone.

AB  - Convolutamydine A has been shown to develop a significant antinociceptive effect.
      Here we demonstrated that new analogues
      (5-iodo-3-(2-oxopropyl)-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole (5-Iisa),
      5-fluoro-3-(2-oxopropyl)-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole (5-Fisa),
      5-chloro-3-(2-oxopropyl)-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole (5-Clisa) and
      5-methyl-3-(2-oxopropyl)-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole (5-Meisa)), at 0.1-10mg/kg doses,
      have significant peripheral and central antinociceptive effects in thermal and
      chemical models of nociception. Oral administered analogues demonstrated more
      pronounced antinociceptive effects than that obtained with the classical opioid
      drug morphine (5mg/kg) in the first and second phases of formalin-induced
      licking. In the tail flick model, 5-Clisa and 5-Meisa antinociceptive effect was 
      almost twice as that observed with the same dose of morphine. The concomitant
      administration of diverse antagonists and the analogues indicates that 5-Iisa
      effects involve the activation of opioid pathway. On the other hand, 5-Fisa and
      5-Clisa have the participation of opioid, nitrergic, cholinergic adrenergic and
      serotoninergic pathways and 5-Meisa has the involvement of opioid, serotoninergic
      and cholinergic pathways. In conclusion, our results suggest that the new four
      analogues from Convolutamydine A have significant antinociceptive effects in
      thermal and chemical induced nociception and could be used in development of new 
      drugs to be used in pain treatment with reduced side effects.

TI  - Appropriateness and delay to initiate therapy in ventilator-associated pneumonia.
PG  - 158-64
AB  - Inappropriate therapy (IT) and delayed initiation of appropriate therapy (DIAT)
      result in inadequate therapy in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia
      (VAP). The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of DIAT in VAP. A
      total of 76 mechanically ventilated patients with bacteriologically confirmed VAP
      were prospectively evaluated in the intensive care unit of six hospitals in
      Buenos Aires, Argentina. Appropriate therapy was defined as coverage of all the
      identified pathogens by the antimicrobial therapy administered at the time of VAP
      clinical diagnosis. The clinical pulmonary infection score was measured during
      the 3 days before, at the onset and during the days which followed the onset of
      VAP. A total of 24 patients received adequate therapy; mortality was 29.2%. The
      remaining 52 patients received either IT (n = 16) or DIAT (n = 36); the mortality
      was 63.5% combined, and 75.0 and 58.3% for IT and DIAT, respectively
      (statistically significant compared with adequate therapy). Inappropriate therapy
      and delayed initiation of appropriate therapy increased the mortality of
      ventilator-associated pneumonia. Patients with inappropriate therapy and/or
      delayed initiation of appropriate therapy had a more gradual increase in clinical
      pulmonary infection score than those receiving adequate therapy, and this
      increase was found to occur prior to the time of the clinical diagnosis. In
      conclusion, these findings might provide the rationale for a trial of earlier
      initiation of therapy, based on clinical grounds in an effort to improve the
      outcome of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  - A Homology Based Model and Virtual Screening of Inhibitors for Human
      Geranylgeranyl Transferase 1 (GGTase1).
PG  - 973-7
LID - 10.6026/97320630009973 [doi]
AB  - Protein prenylation is a post translational modification that is indispensable
      for Ras-Rho mediated tumorigenesis. In mammals, three enzymes namely protein
      farnesyltransferase (FTase), geranylgeranyl transferase1 (GGTase1), and
      geranylgeranyl transferase2 (GGTase2) were found to be involved in this process. 
      Usually proteins of Ras family will be farnesylated by FTase, Rho family will be 
      geranylgeranylated by GGTase1. GGTase2 is exclusive for geranylgeranylating Rab
      protein family. FTase inhibitors such as FTI- 277 are potent anti-cancer agents
      in vitro. In vivo, mutated Ras proteins can either improve their affinity for
      FTase active site or undergo geranylgeranylation which confers resistance and no 
      activity of FTase inhibitors. This led to the development of GGTase1 inhibitors. 
      A well-defined 3-D structure of human GGTase1 protein is lacking which impairs
      its in silico and rational designing of inhibitors. A 3-D structure of human
      GGTase1 was constructed based on primary sequence available and homology modeling
      to which pubchem molecules library was virtually screened through AutoDock Vina. 
      Our studies show that natural compounds Camptothecin (-8.2 Kcal/mol), Curcumin
      (-7.3 Kcal/mol) have higher binding affinities to GGTase-1 than that of
      established peptidomimetic GGTase-1 inhibitors such as GGTI-297 (-7.5 Kcal/mol), 
      GGTI-298 (-7.5 Kcal/mol), CHEMBL525185 (-7.2 Kcal/mol).

TI  - Subtraction MR images in a multiple sclerosis multicenter clinical trial setting.
PG  - 506-14
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2501080480 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the applicability of subtraction magnetic resonance (MR)
      images to (a) detect active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, (b) directly
      quantify lesion load change, and (c) detect treatment effects (distinguish
      treatment arms) in a placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial by comparing
      the subtraction scheme with a conventional pair-wise comparison of nonregistered 
      MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six pairs of MR studies in 40 patients
      (31 women; mean age, 31.9 years) from a multicenter clinical trial were used. The
      clinical trial was approved by local ethics review boards, and all subjects gave 
      written informed consent. Active MS lesions were scored by two independent
      raters, and lesion load measurements were conducted by using semiautomated
      software. Lesion counts were evaluated by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test,
      interrater agreement was evaluated by using the intraclass correlation
      coefficient (ICC), and treatment (interferon beta-1b) effect was evaluated by
      using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: When subtraction images were used, there 
      was a 1.7-fold increase in the detection of positive active lesions, as compared 
      with native image pairs, and significantly greater interobserver agreement (ICC =
      0.98 vs 0.91, P < .001). Subtraction images also allowed direct quantification of
      positive disease activity, a measure that provided sufficient power to
      distinguish treatment arms (P = .012) compared with the standard measurement of
      total lesion load change on native images (P = .455). CONCLUSION: MR image
      subtraction enabled detection of higher numbers of active MS lesions with greater
      interobserver agreement and exhibited increased power to distinguish treatment
      arms, as compared with a conventional pair-wise comparison of nonregistered MR
      images.

AB  - Variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) B antibodies of the evolutionary distant sea
      lamprey are structurally distinct from conventional mammalian antibodies. The
      different protein architecture and large evolutionary distance of jawless
      vertebrates suggest that VLR antibodies may represent promising tools for
      biomarker discovery. Here we report the generation of panels of monoclonal VLR
      antibodies from lamprey larvae immunized with human T cells and the use of a
      recombinant monoclonal VLR antibody for antigen purification and mass
      spectrometric identification. We demonstrate that despite predicted low affinity 
      of individual VLR antigen binding units to the antigen, the high avidity
      resulting from decameric assembly of secreted VLR antibodies allows for efficient
      antigen capture and subsequent identification by mass spectometry. We show that
      VLR antibodies detect their antigens with high specificity and can be used in
      various standard laboratory application techniques. The lamprey antibodies are
      novel reagents that can complement conventional monoclonal antibodies in multiple
      scientific research disciplines.

TI  - Garbled messages and corrupted translations.
PG  - 189-198
AB  - Following transcription, genomic information begins a long journey toward
      translation of its nucleotide sequence into the amino acids of a protein. In
      eukaryotes, synthesized pre-mRNAs become processed to mature mRNAs by 5'-end
      capping, splicing, 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation in the nucleus, before
      being scrutinized for premature stop codons. Each step requires high precision
      and control to ensure that an intact and readable message is exported to the
      cytoplasm before finally becoming translated. Two important aspects of these
      processes are accurately managed by ribonucleoprotein machineries-the spliceosome
      and the ribosome. Recently, several natural products targeting these
      macromolecular assemblies have been reported. For the first time in eukaryotes,
      these molecules allow chemical disruption and dissection of the sophisticated
      machinery that regulates post-transcriptional events. Beyond their great
      potential as bioprobes for investigating mRNA regulation and protein synthesis,
      these compounds also show promise in opening new therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Flares of Disease in Children with Clinically Inactive Juvenile Idiopathic
      Arthritis Were Not Correlated with Ultrasound Findings.
PG  - 851-857
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.170681 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The validity of our current definitions for clinically inactive
      disease (CID) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) based on physical
      examination is challenged by the development of advanced musculoskeletal imaging 
      tools. We aimed to prospectively determine the prevalence of abnormal ultrasound 
      (US) findings in children with CID in JIA and their clinical significance.
      METHODS: Children aged >/= 4 years with CID and a history of arthritis from a
      single tertiary center were approached over 1 year. Standard US of knees,
      tibiotalar joints, subtalar joints, and wrists were performed at baseline and at 
      a followup visit. US images were scored by 2 pediatric musculoskeletal
      radiologists. RESULTS: Forty children with CID were enrolled and followed
      clinically. The median duration of inactive disease was 1 year. The most common
      International League of Associations for Rheumatology JIA categories were
      extended oligoarticular JIA (30%) and rheumatoid factor-negative polyarthritis
      (38%). At baseline, among a total of 289 joints scanned, 24 joints (8%) had at
      least 1 abnormal finding in 18 (45%) of 40 subjects. When evaluated at the
      individual joint level against flares identified during followup exams, these
      baseline US findings had a sensitivity of 15% and a positive predictive value of 
      12%. The predictive performance of the second US was even less. CONCLUSION: Our
      study demonstrates that nearly half of children with CID had abnormal US findings
      in 1 of 8 commonly affected joints. These findings did not correlate with
      subsequent clinical flares in up to 2 years of followup.

PG  - 763-5
AB  - We demonstrate and characterize the generation of single-tone frequency-modulated
      and frequency-doubled radiation at 400 MHz and 430 nm. We obtained the radiation 
      at 430 nm by frequency doubling light from a current-modulated 860-nm diode
      laser, using noncritical type I phase matching in a KNbO(3) crystal. The optical 
      spectrum of the doubled light was found to be in keeping with our expectations
      based on the measured frequency- and amplitude-modulation indices of the
      fundamental radiation. The experimentally measured diode laser and crystal
      parameters were used to simulate the in-phase and quadrature signals that would
      be observed in a single-tone frequency-modulation spectroscopy experiment.

TI  - The management of solitary tumours of Hoffa's fat pad.
PG  - 67-70
LID - 10.1016/j.knee.2010.02.002 [doi]
AB  - Hoffa's fat pad (HFP) of the knee is affected by a variety of tumours and
      tumour-like conditions. HFP can be affected by diffuse or solitary, focal
      disease. This paper reports a consecutive series of 19 cases of solitary
      symptomatic HFP tumours. The commonest presenting symptom was anterior knee pain.
      All patients underwent open excision after diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI). Histology revealed varied diagnoses with the commonest being pigmented
      villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and ganglia. American Knee Society scores improved 
      from 76 pre-operatively to 96 post-operatively with an improvement in functional 
      scores from 92 to 100. In conclusion the majority of solitary HFP tumours are
      benign and may be either cystic or solid. MRI and plain radiographs are the
      imaging of choice. The definitive treatments of both cystic and solid tumours
      should be selective arthrotomy and excision biopsy. All patients in this series
      reported substantial improvement in symptoms following surgery.

TI  - Incidence of postoperative gallstone disease after antiobesity surgery:
      population-based study from Sweden.
PG  - 54-8
LID - 10.1016/j.soard.2009.03.221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who have undergone antiobesity surgery are at risk of
      developing gallstones postoperatively. The aim of the present study was to assess
      the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease in patients who have undergone
      antiobesity surgery compared with that of the general population. METHODS: We
      performed a population-based cohort study of antiobesity surgery in Sweden from
      1980 to 2006. A total of 8901 patients who had undergone antiobesity surgery and 
      had not previously been treated for gallstone disease were identified from the
      Inpatient Care Register. For each subject, 10 controls matched for age and
      gender, were identified in the register of the total population (89,010).
      Censoring occurred at the end of the study (December 31, 2006), date of
      emigration, or date of death (9.1 +/- 6.6 years of follow-up). RESULTS: The
      incidence of gallstone disease was 122.2/10,000 person-years in the surgical
      group compared with 22.2/10,000 person-years in the controls. The incidence of
      cholecystectomy was greater in the surgical group than in the controls (106.1
      versus 19.5/10,000 person-years). The incidence ratio for gallstone disease was
      5.5 (range 5.05.9) and for cholecystectomy was 5.4 (range 5.0-5.9). CONCLUSION: A
      fivefold increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease was found after
      antiobesity surgery compared with that in the general population.

PG  - 539-62
AB  - This paper focuses on the response of the Royal Society to the increasing contact
      with parts of the globe beyond Europe. Such contact was in accord with the
      programme of Baconian natural history that the early Royal Society espoused, but 
      it also raised basic questions about the extent and nature of the pursuit of
      natural history. In particular, the paper is concerned with the attention paid to
      one particular branch of natural history, the study of other peoples and their
      customs. Such scrutiny of other peoples in distant lands raised basic questions
      about what methods natural history should employ and the extent to which it could
      serve as a foundation for more general and theoretical claims. By taking a wide
      sweep from the beginnings of the Royal Society until the end of the eighteenth
      century it is hoped light will be shed on the changing understanding of natural
      history over this period.

TI  - Characterisation of proteins extracted from the surface of Salmonella Typhimurium
      grown under SPI-2-inducing conditions by LC-ESI/MS/MS sequencing.

AB  - Salmonella enterica has two pathogenicity islands encoding separate type three
      secretion systems (T3SS). Proteins secreted through these systems facilitate
      invasion and survival. After entry, Salmonella reside within a membrane bound
      vacuole, the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV), where translocation of a second
      set of effectors by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) T3SS is
      initiated. SPI-2 secretion in vitro can be induced by conditions that mimic the
      Salmonella containing vacuole. Utilising high-throughput mass spectrometry, we
      mapped the surface-attached proteome of S. Typhimurium SL1344 grown in vitro
      under SPI-2-inducing conditions and identified 108 proteins; using secretion
      signal prediction software, 43% of proteins identified contained a signal
      sequence. Of these proteins, 13 were known secreted effector proteins including
      SPI-2 effector proteins SseB, SseC, SseD, SseL, PipB2 and SteC, although
      surprisingly five were SPI-1 proteins, SipA, SipB, SipC, SipD and SopD, while 2
      proteins SteA and SlrP are secreted by both T3SSs. This is the first in vitro
      study to demonstrate dual secretion of SPI-1 and SPI-2 proteins by S. Typhimurium
      and demonstrates the potential of high-throughput LC-ESI/MS/MS sequencing for the
      identification of novel proteins, providing a platform for subsequent comparative
      proteomic analysis, which should greatly assist understanding of the pathogenesis
      and inherent variation between serovars of Salmonella and ultimately help towards
      development of novel control strategies.

AB  - This study examined relationships among individual demographics, environmental
      features (e.g., fast food outlet density, park land use) of residential
      neighborhoods and activity spaces, and weight-related behaviors (diet, physical
      activity). Participants' movement was tracked for 7 days using global positioning
      systems (GPS). Two activity space measures (one standard deviation ellipse, daily
      path area) were derived from the GPS data. Activity spaces were generally larger 
      than residential neighborhoods; environmental features of residential
      neighborhoods and activity spaces were weakly associated; and some activity space
      environmental features were related to dietary behaviors. Activity spaces may
      provide new insights into environmental influences on obesity-related behaviors.

TI  - Classroom Listening Conditions in Indian Primary Schools: A Survey of Four
      Schools.
PG  - 31-40

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Background noise affects the listening environment inside
      classrooms, especially for younger children. High background noise level
      adversely affects not only student speech perception but also teacher vocal
      hygiene. The current study aimed to give an overview of the classroom listening
      conditions in selected government primary schools in India. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Noise measurements were taken in 23 classrooms of four government
      primary schools in southern India, using a type 2 sound level meter. In each
      classroom measurements were taken in occupied and unoccupied conditions. Teacher 
      voice level was measured in the same classrooms. In addition, the classroom
      acoustical conditions were observed and the reverberation time for each classroom
      was calculated. RESULTS: The mean occupied noise level was 62.1 dBA and 65.6 dBC,
      and the mean unoccupied level was 62.2 dBA and 65 dBC. The mean unamplified
      teacher speech-to-noise ratio was 10.6 dBA. Both the occupied and unoccupied
      noise levels exceeded national and international recommended levels and the
      teacher speech-to-noise ratio was also found to be inadequate in most classrooms.
      The estimated reverberation time in all classrooms was greater than 2.6 seconds, 
      which is almost double the duration of accepted standards. In addition,
      observation of classrooms revealed insufficient acoustical treatment to
      effectively reduce internal and external noise and minimize reverberation.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study point out the need to improve the listening
      environment for children in government primary schools in India.

AB  - Nicotine can have beneficial effects on attention performance and corresponding
      brain function in both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, but it
      remains controversial whether nicotine affects brain function differentially in
      patients vs. controls. The effects of nicotine on brain activity elicited by
      attention-requiring oddball-type tasks have not been studied in schizophrenia
      patients. In this study we sought to investigate the impact of nicotine on the
      p300 evoked potential component and corresponding fMRI (functional magnetic
      resonance imaging) activation measures in schizophrenia patients and controls.
      Applying a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, the effects of 1mg
      nasal nicotine on brain activity elicited by a visual oddball-type task in N=14
      schizophrenia and N=15 control smokers were studied with simultaneous EEG-fMRI.
      EEG single trial amplitudes were used to inform the fMRI analysis. We found a
      nicotine-associated increase in P300-informed fMRI activation in schizophrenia
      patients and controls, mainly in the anterior cingulate and adjacent medial
      frontal cortex. No group differences in the response to nicotine were found.
      Remarkably, averaged EEG and fMRI activation measures considered in isolation
      were largely unaffected by nicotine. Taken together, the effects of nicotine on
      P300 amplitude-associated brain activation do not seem to be fundamentally
      different in schizophrenic smokers and healthy controls.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of vernakalant hydrochloride 
      injection (RSD1235) in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
PG  - 541-62
LID - 10.1007/s10928-011-9207-3 [doi]
AB  - Vernakalant hydrochloride is a novel, relatively atrial-selective antiarrhythmic 
      agent that rapidly converts atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR). This
      analysis integrates pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data from 5 clinical trials
      of patients with AF or atrial flutter (AFL). Patients were initially given a
      10-min intravenous (IV) infusion of vernakalant 3 mg/kg or placebo. If SR was not
      evident after a 15-min observation, then a second 10-min IV infusion of
      vernakalant 2 mg/kg or placebo was given. Population
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models were constructed for QT interval
      prolongation corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) and for
      changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP). The exposure-response relationships for
      QTcF and SBP were best described by sigmoidal maximum-effect (E (max)) models.
      For QTcF, the model was characterized by a typical E (max) of 20.3 ms, and by a
      vernakalant median effective concentration dependent (EC(5)(0)) on conversion
      status (4,222 ng/ml for patients converting to SR and 2,276 ng/ml for those
      remaining in AF/AFL). For SBP, the model was characterized by E (max) of 3.05
      mmHg and EC(5)(0) of 1,141 ng/ml. Risk of hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg) was
      primarily associated with low baseline SBP and to a smaller extent with a history
      of congestive heart failure (CHF); plasma vernakalant concentrations showed a
      small contribution to the risk of hypotension (relative risk = 1.4 at 4,000
      ng/ml), which may be significant with a baseline SBP of <105 mmHg. These results 
      show that vernakalant had a smaller effect on QTcF in patients who demonstrated
      conversion to SR than those remaining in AF or AFL, and it had a relatively small
      effect on SBP.

      including a more influential leadership at senior levels of policy development.
      Decades of research, good will, and a revolutionary civil rights movement have
      not resolved the world's staggering health outcome disparities. Nursing has a
      solution: Many of the most troubling disparities are amenable to effective
      intervention by the world's nurses through their clinical and policy work. The
      author challenges nurses to imagine the impact on global health if the
      elimination of disparities is the core goal of nursing for the 21st century.
      Moving from individuals and communities to systems levels, nurses must be versed 
      in a range of system-level vital signs that affect policy development including
      economics, demographics, and access to care. Setting our sights on the
      elimination of health disparities offers a rallying point around which nursing
      can coalesce and set human health on a new and more equitable course.

      in the primary mouse macrophages and mouse models.

AB  - Geniposide, a main iridoid glucoside component of gardenia fruit, has been known 
      to exhibit antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and other important therapeutic
      activities. The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects
      of geniposide on inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated primary
      mouse macrophages in vitro and LPS induced lung injury model in vivo. The
      expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was determined by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), inhibitory kappa
      B (IkappaBalpha) protein, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were determined by
      Western blot. Further analysis was carried out in mTLR4 and mMD-2 co-transfected 
      HEK293 cells. The results showed that geniposide markedly inhibited the
      LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta production both in vitro and in vivo.
      Geniposide blocked the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, p65, p38, ERK and JNK in 
      LPS stimulated primary mouse macrophages. Furthermore, geniposide inhibited the
      expression of TLR4 in LPS stimulated primary mouse macrophages and inhibited the 
      LPS-induced IL-8 production in HEK293-mTLR4/MD-2 cells. In vivo study, it was
      also observed that geniposide attenuated lung histopathologic changes in the
      mouse models. These results suggest that geniposide exerts an anti-inflammatory
      property by down-regulating the expression of TLR4 up-regulated by LPS.
      Geniposide is highly effective in inhibiting acute lung injury and may be a
      promising potential therapeutic reagent for acute lung injury treatment.

TI  - Deep and unusual sialolithiasis of submandibular duct and gland: a surgical
      dilemma.
PG  - 309-13
LID - 10.1007/s12070-012-0503-z [doi]
AB  - Giant solitary submandibular duct calculus and multiple calculi of the gland are 
      extremely rare. This occurrence along with more deep and proximally placed common
      calculi in submandibular gland may occasionally cause a dilemma in selection of
      the appropriate surgical approach in the present era of sialoendoscopic surgery. 
      There is a high chance of fracture of the stone in a proximally placed stone in
      the gland followed by likely dissemination of fragments of the stone into the
      gland parenchyma during the procedure of sialoendoscopy which is a matter of
      grave concern. We authors believe that excision of the submandibular gland with
      the stone in such a situation should still be preferred as the gold standard of
      treatment leaving the ductal stone for endoscopic removal.

AB  - A mathematical model that describes the transmission dynamics of bovine
      tuberculosis (BTB) in both buffalo and cattle populations is proposed. The model 
      incorporates cross-infection and contaminated environment transmission routes. A 
      full analysis of the model is undertaken. The reproduction number of the entire
      model is comprised of cross-infection and contaminated parameters. This
      underscores the importance of including both cross-infection and contaminated
      environment transmission routes. Crucially our simulations suggest that the
      disease has a more devastating effect on cattle populations than on buffalo
      populations when all transmission routes are involved. This has important
      implications for agriculture and tourism.

PG  - 591-603
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2011.8.591 [doi]
AB  - In the paper we propose a new methodology in modeling of antiangiogenic treatment
      on the basis of well recognized model formulated by Hahnfeldt et al. in 1999. On 
      the basis of the Hahnfeldt et al. model, with the usage of the optimal control
      theory, some protocols of antiangiogenic treatment were proposed. However, in our
      opinion the formulation of that model is valid only for the antivascular
      treatment, that is treatment that is focused on destroying endothelial cells.
      Therefore, we propose a modification of the original model which is valid in the 
      case of the antiangiogenic treatment, that is treatment which is focused on
      blocking angiogenic signaling. We analyze basic mathematical properties of the
      proposed model and present some numerical simulations.

PG  - 1563-1572
LID - 10.1101/gr.219493.116 [doi]
AB  - Natural selection that affected modern humans early in their evolution has likely
      shaped some of the traits that set present-day humans apart from their closest
      extinct and living relatives. The ability to detect ancient natural selection in 
      the human genome could provide insights into the molecular basis for these
      human-specific traits. Here, we introduce a method for detecting ancient
      selective sweeps by scanning for extended genomic regions where our closest
      extinct relatives, Neandertals and Denisovans, fall outside of the present-day
      human variation. Regions that are unusually long indicate the presence of
      lineages that reached fixation in the human population faster than expected under
      neutral evolution. Using simulations, we show that the method is able to detect
      ancient events of positive selection and that it can differentiate those from
      background selection. Applying our method to the 1000 Genomes data set, we find
      evidence for ancient selective sweeps favoring regulatory changes and present a
      list of genomic regions that are predicted to underlie positively selected human 
      specific traits.

TI  - Evolution of intermolecular structure and dynamics in supercritical carbon
      dioxide with pressure: an ab initio molecular dynamics study.
PG  - 387-92
AB  - The effect of pressure on supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has been
      characterized by using Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations. Structural 
      and dynamical properties along an isotherm of 318.15 K and at pressures ranging
      from 190 to 5000 bar have been obtained. Intermolecular pair correlation
      functions and three-dimensional atomic probability density map calculations
      indicate that the local environment of a central CO2 molecule becomes more
      structured with increasing pressure. The closest neighbors are predominantly
      oriented in a distorted T-shaped geometry while neighbors separated by larger
      distances are likely oriented in a slipped parallel arrangement. The structure of
      scCO2 at high densities has been compared with that of crystalline CO2. The
      probability distributions of intramolecular distances narrow down with increasing
      pressure. A marginal but non-negligible effect of pressure on the instantaneous
      intramolecular OCO angle is observed, lending credence to the idea that
      intermolecular interactions between CO2 molecules in an inhomogeneous near
      neighbor environment could contribute to the observed instantaneous molecular
      dipole moment. The extent of deviation from a perfect linear geometry of the
      carbon dioxide molecule decreases with increasing pressure. Time constants
      derived from reorientational time correlation functions of the molecular backbone
      compare well with experimental data. Within the range of thermodynamic conditions
      explored here, no significant changes are observed in the frequencies of
      intramolecular vibrational modes. However, a blue shift is observed in the
      low-frequency cage rattling mode with increasing pressure.

TI  - Soft bounds on diffusion produce skewed distributions and Gompertz growth.
PG  - 032805
AB  - Constraints can affect dramatically the behavior of diffusion processes.
      Recently, we analyzed a natural and a technological system and reported that they
      perform diffusion-like discrete steps displaying a peculiar constraint, whereby
      the increments of the diffusing variable are subject to configuration-dependent
      bounds. This work explores theoretically some of the revealing landmarks of such 
      phenomenology, termed "soft bound." At long times, the system reaches a steady
      state irreversibly (i.e., violating detailed balance), characterized by a skewed 
      "shoulder" in the density distribution, and by a net local probability flux,
      which has entropic origin. The largest point in the support of the distribution
      follows a saturating dynamics, expressed by the Gompertz law, in line with
      empirical observations. Finally, we propose a generic allometric scaling for the 
      origin of soft bounds. These findings shed light on the impact on a system of
      such "scaling" constraint and on its possible generating mechanisms.

TI  - Signaling and transcriptional changes critical for transformation of human cells 
      by simian virus 40 small tumor antigen or protein phosphatase 2A B56gamma
      knockdown.
PG  - 6978-88
AB  - One set of genes sufficient for transformation of primary human cells uses the
      combination of Ha-Ras-V12, the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT, SV40 large
      tumor antigen (LT), and SV40 small tumor antigen (ST). Whereas SV40 LT
      inactivates the retinoblastoma protein and p53, the contribution of ST is poorly 
      understood. The essential helper function of ST requires a functional interaction
      with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Here we have identified changes in gene
      expression induced by ST and show that ST mediates these changes through both
      PP2A-dependent and PP2A-independent mechanisms. Knockdown of PP2A B56gamma
      subunit can substitute for ST expression to fully transform cells expressing LT, 
      hTERT, and Ras-V12. We also identify those genes affected similarly in two cell
      lines that have been fully transformed from a common parental line by two
      alternative mechanisms, namely ST expression or PP2A B56gamma subunit knockdown. 
      ST altered expression of genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, integrin
      signaling, development, immune responses, and transcriptional regulation. ST
      reduced surface expression of MHC class I molecules, consistent with a need for
      SV40 to evade immune detection. ST expression enabled cell cycle progression in
      reduced serum and src phosphorylation in anchorage-independent media, whereas
      B56gamma knockdown required normal serum levels for these phenotypes. Inhibitors 
      of integrin and src signaling prevented anchorage-independent growth of
      transformed cells, suggesting that integrin and src activation are key
      ST-mediated events in transformation. Our data support a model in which ST
      promotes survival through constitutive integrin signaling, src phosphorylation,
      and nuclear factor kappaB activation, while inhibiting cell-cell adhesion
      pathways.

TI  - Resistance pathways of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 against the
      combination of zidovudine and lamivudine.
PG  - 1898-1908
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.022657-0 [doi]
AB  - A better understanding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug-resistance
      evolution under the selective pressure of combination treatment is important for 
      the design of long-term effective treatment strategies. We applied Bayesian
      network learning to sequences from patients treated with the reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor combination of zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) to
      identify the role of many treatment-selected mutations in the development of
      resistance. Based on the Bayesian network structure, an in vivo fitness landscape
      was built, reflecting the necessary selective pressure under treatment, to evolve
      naive sequences to sequences obtained from patients treated with the combination.
      This landscape, combined with an evolutionary model, was used to predict
      resistance evolution in longitudinal sequence pairs. In our analysis, mutations
      41L, 70R, 184V and 215F/Y were identified as major resistance mutations to the
      combination of AZT and 3TC, as they were associated directly with treatment
      experience. The network also suggested a possible role in resistance development 
      for a number of novel mutations. Estimated fitness, using the landscape,
      correlated significantly with in vitro resistance phenotype in genotype-phenotype
      pairs (R(2)=0.70). Variation in predicted evolution under selective pressure
      correlated significantly with observed in vivo evolution during AZT plus 3CT
      treatment. In conclusion, we confirmed current knowledge on resistance
      development to the combination of AZT and 3CT, but additional novel mutations
      were identified. Moreover, a model to predict resistance evolution during AZT and
      3CT treatment has been built and validated.

TI  - Slurry sampling for direct analysis of solid materials by electrothermal atomic
      absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). A literature review from 1990 to 2000.
PG  - 1-51
AB  - The determination of trace metals in solid samples has traditionally been
      performed by acid digestion and subsequent measurement by a suitable instrumental
      technique. This dissolution step is time-consuming and it shows important
      drawbacks. For these reasons, in the past years many efforts have been focused on
      the direct analysis of solid samples. Among the developed methodologies, slurry
      sampling-electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry combines the significant
      advantages of the solid and liquid sampling methods, and it can be already
      considered as a mature technique, that is widely utilized for metal determination
      in both organic and inorganic matrices, even for routine analysis. Accordingly,
      this work gives a retrospective view of the progresses of this technique during
      the past decade (1990-2000).

AB  - Element load, conventional biomarkers and altered protein expression profiles
      were studied in Carcinus maenas crabs, to assess contamination of "Domingo Rubio"
      stream, an aquatic ecosystem that receives pyritic metals, industrial
      contaminants, and pesticides. Lower antioxidative activities -
      glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, catalase - were found 
      in parallel to higher levels of damaged biomolecules - malondialdehyde, oxidized 
      glutathione -, due to oxidative lesions promoted by contaminants, as the
      increased levels of essential - Zn, Cu, Co - and nonessential - Cr, Ni, Cd -
      elements. Utility of Proteomics to assess environmental quality was confirmed,
      especially after considering the six proteins identified by de novo sequencing
      through capLC-muESI-ITMS/MS and homology search on databases. They include
      tripartite motif-containing protein 11 and ATF7 transcription factor
      (upregulated), plus CBR-NHR-218 nuclear hormone receptor, two components of the
      ABC transporters and aldehyde dehydrogenase (downregulated). These proteins could
      be used as novel potential biomarkers of the deleterious effects of pollutants
      present in the area.

      short anal cleft. On questioning, the mother reported insulin-dependent diabetes 
      mellitus during pregnancy. MRI of the spinal cord demonstrated a thoracic
      syringomyelia, a dysplastic conus medullaris, and an absence of coccyx and distal
      sacrum, called caudal regression syndrome or caudal agenesis. CONCLUSION: The
      caudal regression syndrome refers to sacral agenesis associated with spinal cord 
      anomalies, e.g. syringomyelia. Sacral agenesis is marked by total absence of the 
      coccyx and total or distal absence of the sacrum. An abnormal backside combined
      with a history of maternal diabetes mellitus in pregnancy is highly suggestive
      for the presence of caudal regression syndrome.

TI  - [Clinical competence in Nephrology: proposal of an evaluation pathway and
      definition of professional levels].
LID - 2017-vol6 [pii]
AB  - The need to assess clinical competencies in a medical environment is an
      intriguing issue due to progressive involvement of young physicians in clinical
      practice, as well as for connections tied to evaluation systems to define
      postgraduate training and career progression. To reach this goal, system must be 
      based upon contributions that are aimed to achieve a clear and homogeneous
      evaluation pathway and strictly related to the continuing medical education
      institution (credits). All these presuppositions are instrumental for the
      proposal of a sheet which could allow a data retrieval useful to depict a career 
      progression by means of: identification of reproducible parameters along with
      clear standards; advices for indicators; objective judgments that could drive to 
      a score meaningful for reaching higher steps in the performance evaluation. This 
      work had been carried out at Local Health Authority 1 of Cuneo (ASLCN1) from 2014
      to 2017 in order to provide a widely usable evaluation framework for all the
      medical workers. Aim of this work is thus to show up an original methodology, as 
      much as possible based upon objective items, related to the professional
      improvement of a nephrologist working in Hospital and following him along his
      clinical course.

TI  - Palliative interventions for hepatocellular carcinoma patients: analysis of the
      National Cancer Database.
PG  - 26-35
LID - 10.21037/apm.2016.11.02 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Palliative therapies are provided to a subset of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) patients with the aim of providing symptomatic relief, better
      quality of life and improved survival. The present study sought to assess and
      compare the efficacy of different palliative therapies for HCC. METHODS: The
      National Cancer Database (NCDB), a retrospective national database that captures 
      approximately 70% of all patients treated for cancer in the US, was queried for
      patients with HCC who were deemed unresectable from 1998-2011. Patients were
      stratified by receipt of palliative therapy. Survival analysis was examined by
      log-rank test and Kaplan Meier curves, and a multivariate proportional hazards
      model was utilized to identify the predictors of survival. RESULTS: A total of
      3,267 patients were identified; 287 (8.7%) received surgical palliation, 827
      (25.3%) received radiotherapy (RT), 877 (26.8%) received chemotherapy, 1,067
      (32.6%) received pain management therapy, while 209 (6.4%) received a combination
      of the previous three modalities. On multivariate analysis palliative RT was
      identified as a positive predictor of survival [hazards ratio (HR) 0.65; 95% CI, 
      0.50-0.83]. Stratifying by disease stage, palliative RT provided a significant
      survival benefit for patients with stage IV disease. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative RT
      appears to extend survival and should be considered for patients presenting with 
      late stage HCC.

TI  - The Role of Habits in Anorexia Nervosa: Where We Are and Where to Go From Here?
PG  - 61
LID - 10.1007/s11920-018-0928-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The persistent maladaptive eating behavior characteristic of
      anorexia nervosa (AN) can be understood as a learned habit. This review describes
      the cognitive neuroscience background and the existing data from research in AN. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Behavior is habitual after it is frequently repeated and becomes
      nearly automatic, relatively insensitive to outcome, and mediated by dorsal
      frontostriatal neural systems. There is evidence for such behavior in AN, in
      which restrictive intake has been related to dorsal frontostriatal systems. Other
      neural and neurocognitive data provide mixed findings, some of which suggest
      disturbances in habit systems in AN. There are compelling behavioral and neural
      data to suggest that habit systems may underlie the persistence of AN. The habit 
      model needs further research, via more direct behavioral hypothesis testing and
      probes of the development of habitual behavior. Investigation of the
      habit-centered model of AN may open avenues for the development of novel
      treatments.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of human group C rotavirus circulating in Brazil reveals a 
      potential unique NSP4 genetic variant and high similarity with Asian strains.
PG  - 969-86
LID - 10.1007/s00438-014-0971-9 [doi]
AB  - Group C rotaviruses (RVC) cause gastroenteritis in humans and animals worldwide, 
      and the evidence for a possible zoonotic role has been recently provided. To gain
      information on the genetic diversity and relationships between human and animal
      RVC, we sequenced the VP4, VP7, and NSP4 genes of 12, 19, and 15 human strains,
      respectively, detected in Sao Paulo state during historical (1988 and 1993) and
      recent (2007 and 2008) Brazilian rotavirus surveillance. All RVC strains analyzed
      in the present study grouped into human genotype (G4-P[2]-E2), and did not show
      any evidence of animal ancestry. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RVC samples
      detected in 1988 and 1993 clustered together with strains from distinct
      continents, indicating that historical RVC strains circulating in Sao Paulo were 
      closely related to those strains circulating worldwide. All three genes (VP7, VP4
      and NSP4) of Sao Paulo RVC strains isolated in 2007-2008 exhibited close
      phylogenetic relationship with human RVC strains isolated in China and Japan,
      suggesting that they are genetically linked, and that a gene flow could be
      occurring between this Asian countries and Brazil. We identified two distinct
      clusters in the NSP4 phylogenetic tree. One cluster formed exclusively by human
      Brazilian strains detected in 1997 and 2003-2004 in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and
      Rio Grande do Sul states (Subgroup II) previously described in a different study,
      that displayed low sequence identities to other human strains formerly published,
      and to the Brazilian RVC strains (Subgroup I) characterized in the present study.
      These data suggests the circulation of two genetic profiles of the NSP4 gene in
      Brazil. High sequence diversity in NSP4 gene was previously reported in Asia, and
      additional diversity in NSP4 RVC strains spreading in the world should be
      expected. More in-depth molecular and epidemiological analysis of human RVC
      throughout the world will be needed to understand their diversity and clarify
      their evolution, as well as to develop classifications schemes.

TI  - The nurse's role in assessing and responding to patients' spiritual needs.
PG  - 37-42
LID - 10.12968/ijpn.1997.3.1.37 [doi]
AB  - The spiritual dimension of health care is becoming increasingly prominent,
      particularly in terminal care. It is not always clear, however, what spiritual
      needs are or who has responsibility for spiritual care. The first part of this
      paper takes the form of a literature review which examines the spiritual
      dimension and spiritual need. Spiritual needs, which may be particularly acute
      during terminal illness, are considered broader than religious needs and include 
      the need for meaning, purpose, fulfilment, hope/will to live, and belief and
      faith in self, others and God. The role of the nurse in assessing and responding 
      to patients' spiritual needs is addressed in the second part of the paper, with
      specific reference to the author's doctoral study. There is indication from this 
      study that certain factors related to the patient, nurse, environment and other
      professionals may hinder the fulfilment of patients' spiritual needs. By
      addressing these factors it may be possible to improve spiritual care and
      therefore the quality of dying patients' remaining days.

TI  - Vertical and horizontal variations in the physiological diversity of the aerobic 
      chemoheterotrophic bacterial microflora in deep southeast coastal plain
      subsurface sediments.
PG  - 1058-65
AB  - Aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacteria were isolated from surface soils and coastal 
      plain subsurface (including deep aquifer) sediments (depths to 265 m) at a study 
      site near Aiken, S.C., by plating on concentrated and dilute media.
      Morphologically distinct colonies were purified, and their responses to 21
      selected physiological tests were determined. These isolates were quite diverse; 
      626 physiologically distinct types (i.e., types with a unique pattern of
      responses to the 21 tests) were detected among the 1,112 isolates obtained.
      Physiologically distinct types were isolated on concentrated and dilute media
      (only 11% overlap between the groups); isolates from surface soils and subsurface
      sediments were also quite different (only 3% overlap). The surface soil isolates 
      more readily utilized all but 1 of 12 carbon sources offered, and a significantly
      larger proportion of them hydrolyzed esculin and gelatin. Only 4% of the
      subsurface isolates fermented glucose, even though 82% of them could use it
      aerobically. l-Malate and d-gluconate were utilized by at least 75% of the
      subsurface isolates, and seven other carbon sources were used by at least 40% of 
      them. Subsurface isolates from different geological formations (depths) and, to a
      lesser extent, from the same geological formation at different boreholes differed
      distinctly in their group responses to certain physiological tests. Moreover,
      sediments from different depths and boreholes contained physiologically distinct 
      types of bacteria. Thus, considerable bacterial diversity was observed in coastal
      plain subsurface sediments, even within defined geological formations.

TI  - [Case of cerebellar hemorrhage complicated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy -
      usefulness of plasma brain natriutetic peptide measurement for the diagnosis].
PG  - 778-81
AB  - A 94-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of altered mental status
      and cerebellar ataxia of left upper and lower extremities. A brain CT scan
      revealed a right cerebellar hemorrhage approximately 15 cc. Plasma brain
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) value on admission was 1,064.6 pg/ml. Twelve-lead ECG
      revealed negative T-wave in V3-V5. Transthoracic echocardiology confirmed an
      ejection fraction of 35%, and left ventricular apical akinesia and basal
      hyperkinesis were seen. Plasma BNP value was dramatically declined in the
      subacute phase of cerebellar hemorrhage. On the 14th day, echocardiography showed
      completely improvement of the left ventricular wall abnormalities. Therefore, we 
      diagnosed having as a Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy is a
      rare complication of acute intracerebral hemorrhage. In the present case, plasma 
      BNP was effective as a screening marker of Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy and serial
      measurement of BNP was made helpful to know cardiac status.

TI  - Differentiating founder and chronic HIV envelope sequences.
PG  - e0171572
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0171572 [doi]
AB  - Significant progress has been made in characterizing broadly neutralizing
      antibodies against the HIV envelope glycoprotein Env, but an effective vaccine
      has proven elusive. Vaccine development would be facilitated if common features
      of early founder virus required for transmission could be identified. Here we
      employ a combination of bioinformatic and operations research methods to
      determine the most prevalent features that distinguish 78 subtype B and 55
      subtype C founder Env sequences from an equal number of chronic sequences. There 
      were a number of equivalent optimal networks (based on the fewest covarying amino
      acid (AA) pairs or a measure of maximal covariance) that separated founders from 
      chronics: 13 pairs for subtype B and 75 for subtype C. Every subtype B optimal
      solution contained the founder pairs 178-346 Asn-Val, 232-236 Thr-Ser, 240-340
      Lys-Lys, 279-315 Asp-Lys, 291-792 Ala-Ile, 322-347 Asp-Thr, 535-620 Leu-Asp,
      742-837 Arg-Phe, and 750-836 Asp-Ile; the most common optimal pairs for subtype C
      were 644-781 Lys-Ala (74 of 75 networks), 133-287 Ala-Gln (73/75) and 307-337
      Ile-Gln (73/75). No pair was present in all optimal subtype C solutions
      highlighting the difficulty in targeting transmission with a single vaccine
      strain. Relative to the size of its domain (0.35% of Env), the alpha4beta7
      binding site occurred most frequently among optimal pairs, especially for subtype
      C: 4.2% of optimal pairs (1.2% for subtype B). Early sequences from 5 subtype B
      pre-seroconverters each exhibited at least one clone containing an optimal
      feature 553-624 (Ser-Asn), 724-747 (Arg-Arg), or 46-293 (Arg-Glu).

TI  - Influence of natural zeolite and nitrification inhibitor on organics degradation 
      and nitrogen transformation during sludge composting.
PG  - 9122
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8918-4 [doi]
AB  - Sludge composting is one of the most widely used treatments for sewage sludge
      resource utilization. Natural zeolite and nitrification inhibitor (NI) are widely
      used during composting and land application for nitrogen conservation,
      respectively. Three composting reactors (A-the control, B-natural zeolite
      addition, and C-3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) addition) were established 
      to investigate the influence of NI and natural zeolite addition on organics
      degradation and nitrogen transformation during sludge composting conducted at the
      lab scale. The results showed that, in comparison with the control, natural
      zeolite addition accelerated organics degradation and the maturity of sludge
      compost was higher, while the DMPP addition slowed down the degradation of
      organic matters. Meanwhile, the nitrogen transformation functional genes
      including those responses for nitrification (amoA and nxrA) and denitrification
      (narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ) were quantified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) to
      investigate the effects of natural zeolites andDMPP addition on nitrogen
      transformation. Although no significant difference in the abundance of nitrogen
      transformation functional genes was observed between treatments, addition of both
      natural zeolite and DMPP increases the final total nitrogen content by 48.6% and 
      23.1%, respectively. The ability of natural zeolite for nitrogen conservation was
      due to the absorption of NH3 by compost, and nitrogen conservation by DMPP was
      achieved by the source reduction of denitrification. Besides, it was assumed that
      the addition of natural zeolite and DMPP may affect the activity of these genes
      instead of the abundance.

TI  - Borderline ovarian tumors: current concepts for prognostic factors and clinical
      management.
PG  - 517-25
AB  - Since their original description in 1929, our knowledge of the natural history
      and molecular pathology of borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) has advanced most
      dramatically over the last decade. It has been estimated that at the time of
      abdominal exploration for a serous ovarian neoplasm, a BOT will be discovered in 
      approximately 15% of cases. These tumors commonly affect women of reproductive
      age, have an excellent overall prognosis and the majority are cured with surgery.
      Nevertheless, a subset of patients with these tumors have an adverse clinical
      outcome and the molecular features of the associated tumor subtype is currently
      being defined. These data have caused some to place this more aggressive subtype 
      of BOT, called micropapillary serous with invasive extraovarian implants, into
      the pathologic continuum with frankly invasive carcinomas. This chapter will
      explore advances in our understanding of the natural history, clinical and
      pathologic features of BOTs and will conclude with a discussion of the molecular 
      prognostic factors that might be targets for future therapy. A special emphasis
      will be placed on points of agreement identified during a recent workshop on BOTs
      sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

TI  - Cardiac Magnetic Resonance T1-Mapping of the Myocardium: Technical Background and
      Clinical Relevance.
PG  - 71-80
LID - 10.1097/RTI.0000000000000270 [doi]
AB  - Myocardial T1-mapping has become feasible over the past decade as emerging
      technological magnetic resonance imaging advances enable increasingly rapid and
      reliable acquisition techniques. A variety of T1-mapping sequences are in
      development, with most allowing for the acquisition of a single-slice T1-map in a
      single breath-hold. The development of these protocols has spurred investigation 
      into a wide range of potential clinical uses, including the characterization of
      cardiomyopathies. Although native T1-mapping provides superior tissue
      characterization, postcontrast T1-mapping is still indispensable for
      extracellular volume quantification. Ongoing and future studies should
      investigate the reliability, reproducibility, accuracy, and precision of
      available techniques and establish disease-specific reference values for
      T1-mapping-based parameters.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intraobserver correlation of
      the different intrapartum-transperineal-ultrasound-parameters(ITU) (angle of
      progression (AoP), progression-distance (PD), head-direction (HD), midline-angle 
      (MLA) and head-perineum distance (HPD)) with contraction and pushing. We
      evaluated 28 nulliparous women at full dilatation under epidural analgesia. We
      performed a transperineal ultrasound evaluating AoP and PD in the longitudinal
      plane, and MLA and HPD in the transverse plane. Interclass correlation
      coefficients (ICC) with 95% CIs and Bland-Altman analysis were used to assess
      intra- and interobserver measurement's repeatability. The ICC of the ITU for the 
      same observer was adequate for all the parameters (p < .005) AoP 0.98 (95%CI,
      0.96-0.99), PD 0.98 (95%CI, 0.97-0.99), MLA 0.99 (95%CI, 0.97-0.99), HPD 0.96
      (95%CI, 0.88-0.99). The ICC of the ITU for interobserver was: AoP 0.93 (95%CI,
      0.79-0.98), PD 0.92 (95%CI, 0.76-0.97), MLA 0.77 (95%CI, 0.42-0.92), HPD 0.47
      (95%CI, -0.12-0.8). The HD had an interobserver correlation of 0.53 (95%CI,
      0.1-0.9) (Kappa C). The mean difference of the AoP was 2.42 degrees , of the PD 1
      mm and 0.28 degrees MLA (Bland-Altman test). ITU has an adequate intra- and
      interobserver correlation for its use with contraction and pushing under epidural
      analgesia. Impact statement What is already known on this subject: The
      intrapartum transperineal ultrasound parameters can be used with contraction and 
      pushing under epidural analgesia. What the results of this study add to what we
      know: ITU may be used to evaluate the difficulty of instrumental delivery/to
      evaluate the difficulty of instrumentation in vaginal operative deliveries and
      this study concludes that ITU is reproducible during uterine contraction with
      pushing. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or
      further research: Therefore, ITU could be used without difficulty with an
      adequate intra- and interobserver correlation for the prediction of
      instrumentation difficulty in operative vaginal deliveries.

TI  - Image quality and dose for a multisource cone-beam CT extremity scanner.
PG  - 144-155
LID - 10.1002/mp.12659 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This work investigates the dose characteristics and image quality of a
      multisource cone-beam CT scanner dedicated for extremity imaging. METHODS: The
      scanner has an x-ray source with three separate anode-cathode units evenly
      distributed along the longitudinal direction. A nominal scan protocol fires the
      three sources sequentially, and a total of 600 projections (200 for each source) 
      are acquired over a source-detector orbit of 210(o) . Dose was measured using a
      Farmer chamber in three CTDI phantoms stacked end-to-end. Measurements were
      performed at the central and four peripheral locations of a CTDI phantom on the
      axial plane and repeated along the longitudinal direction. The extent of 3D
      sampling of the three-source configuration was assessed in the Fourier domain
      through noise power spectrum measurements from air scans and compared with that
      from a single-source scan. A modified Defrise phantom and anthropomorphic knee
      and hand phantoms were used for visual assessment of cone-beam artifacts in the
      reconstructed images. RESULTS: The dose distribution for the three-source
      configuration exhibits radial asymmetry on the axial plane consistent with a
      short-scan geometry. Along the longitudinal direction, the highest dose was
      measured at the central axial plane where the field of view (FOV) from all three 
      sources overlaps and falls off more slowly toward the end compared to a
      single-source configuration. The extent of 3D sampling is improved throughout the
      FOV as each source compensates for missing frequencies from the adjacent source. 
      As a result, the reduction in streak and shading artifacts is apparent in the
      reconstructed images of all three phantoms. The improvement in image quality from
      the three-source configuration is most pronounced in joint spaces farther from
      the central axial plane. CONCLUSIONS: Initial assessment of the multisource
      scanner demonstrated the advantages over single-source designs in a compact
      scanner with large longitudinal FOV. The reduction in cone-beam artifact is
      particularly valuable for extremity imaging where high-contrast articular
      surfaces are present away from the central axial plane and/or throughout the FOV.

TI  - Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and extent and complexity of coronary artery
      disease.
PG  - 52-8
LID - 10.1002/jcla.21643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited number of studies about relationship between serum 
      vitamin D level and presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). We
      assessed the relationship between the extent and complexity of CAD assessed by
      SYNTAX score and 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in patients with stable CAD. METHODS: 
      In the study, 209 consecutive patients with stable CAD (age: 63.1 +/- 10.0 years)
      and 102 healthy control subjects (age 61.3 +/- 13.7 years) were included. Serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured using a direct competitive chemiluminescent
      immunoassay and other biochemical markers were measured in all subjects. All
      subjects underwent coronary angiography and SS was calculated. RESULTS: The mean 
      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of CAD group was lower than the control group (P 
      < 0,001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
      level was independently associated with SYNTAX score (beta = -0.396, P < 0.001), 
      hypertension (beta = -0.183, P = 0.003), high sensitive C-reactive protein (beta 
      = -0.141, P = 0.014), and body mass index (beta = -0.135, P = 0.023) in patient
      group. CONCLUSION: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D level was associated with extent and
      complexity of CAD. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D may play a role in pathogenesis and
      severity of coronary atherosclerosis.

TI  - Examining the mechanisms responsible for lower ROS release rates in liver
      mitochondria from the long-lived house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and big brown 
      bat (Eptesicus fuscus) compared to the short-lived mouse (Mus musculus).
PG  - 467-76
LID - 10.1016/j.mad.2009.05.002 [doi]
AB  - Lower ROS release rate in long-lived species is likely caused by decreased
      reduction of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, but how this is achieved
      remains largely unknown. We compared liver mitochondrial H(2)O(2) release rates
      among endotherms of comparable size and metabolic rate: house sparrow and big
      brown bat (both long-lived) and house mouse (short-lived). We hypothesized that
      low ROS release rates in long-lived species result from (i) lower mitochondrial
      respiration rate, (ii) increased mitochondrial proton conductance ('uncoupling to
      survive'), and/or (iii) increased ETC oxidative capacity ('spare oxidative
      capacity'). H(2)O(2) release rate was 70% lower in bats than mice despite similar
      respiration rates. Consistent with 'uncoupling to survive', proton leakiness was 
      3-fold higher in bats at membrane potentials above 130mV. Basal H(2)O(2) release 
      rate and respiration rates were 2-fold higher in sparrows than mice. Consistent
      with 'spare oxidative capacity', subsaturating succinate decreased H(2)O(2)
      release rate in sparrows but not mice. Moreover, succinate:Cytochrome c
      oxidoreductase activity was 3-fold higher in sparrows, and ETC inhibitors
      increased ROS release rate 20-27-fold in sparrows (with glutamate or
      subsaturating succinate) but only 4-5-fold in mice. Taken together these data
      suggest that complexes I and III are less reduced under physiological conditions 
      in sparrows. We conclude that different long-lived species may use distinct
      mechanisms to lower mitochondrial ROS release rate.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Penile prosthesis implantation has emerged as a definitive
      treatment to restore sexual function to the motivated man with erectile
      dysfunction. Substantial improvements in the design of inflatable devices have
      been made since they first became available more than four decades ago. AIM: To
      review the history of the penile prosthesis, the indications, preoperative
      evaluation, and patient and partner satisfaction. The current approaches to
      addressing intra- and postoperative complications, provide an understanding of
      prosthesis infection, and placement of these devices will be reviewed. METHODS: A
      committee of worldwide experts in this field was assembled during the 2015
      International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM) and performed a systematic
      review of the peer-reviewed published medical literature pertaining to penile
      prosthesis. Particular attention was given to higher level trials when available.
      Recommendations are based upon the Oxford Criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Unfortunately there is limited level 1 and 2 evidence, and where expert opinion
      was utilized, the decision was unanimous within the committee with a goal of
      presenting a clinically relevant guideline pertaining to penile prostheses.
      RESULTS: Penile prosthesis has undergone an evolution over the past 40 years
      resulting in a more effective and reliable treatment for advanced erectile
      dysfunction not responding to less invasive methods including oral treatment with
      PDE5 inhibitors, vacuum erection device, and intracorporal injection therapy. It 
      should be considered an appropriate treatment option for the man who wishes to
      restore erectile function and who understands the potential risk of mechanical
      failure and infection, both of which are less common now as a result of
      improvements made in device design as well as surgical protocols adhered to in
      the operating room. Patients must be clearly informed of the risks associated
      with penile prosthesis including mechanical failure, infection, shortening of the
      penis, change in sensation and configuration of the penis, as well as injury to
      local structures. Intraoperative complications are unusual but do occur and can
      usually be addressed intraoperatively to allow placement of the device at the
      time of initial surgery. Postoperative complications may also be addressed when
      they occur but may require more advanced reconstructive surgical techniques. Men 
      with Peyronie's disease, corporal fibrosis due to infection, trauma, prior
      prosthesis explantation, priapism, and men who have undergone construction of a
      neophallus may require additional advanced maneuvers to obtain optimum results
      with a penile prosthesis. CONCLUSION: Penile prosthesis remains as an important, 
      viable, and effective treatment for male erectile dysfunction that does not
      respond to other less invasive approaches or when these approaches are
      contraindicated or not acceptable to the patient. These devices provide the
      patient with the ability to engage in penetrative sexual activity without
      interfering with urination, ejaculation, sensation, or orgasm. Although
      mechanical failure can occur, the current devices are more reliable as a result
      of design modifications. Infection remains the most dreaded complication but
      since the introduction of antibiotic and hydrophilic coatings, infection is less 
      common. Overall, patient and partner satisfaction appear to be reasonably high
      when a penile prosthesis is used to restore erectile function.

AB  - Objective: To construct and validate a checklist for patient safety in emergency 
      care. Method: This is methodological research conducted in Curitiba, in 2015,
      with construction and validation stages. The checklist was based on the
      guidelines of the Brazilian patient safety programme and validated online using
      the Delphi method, with a questionnaire, and with the participation of 23
      Brazilian specialists in the first round and 20 in the second round. The data
      were analysed using the Content Validity Index (CVI), Cronbach's alpha, and
      Fisher's Exact Test. Results: We produced a checklist with 18 valid and reliable 
      items (94% of CVI, Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). Conclusions: The checklist comprises
      patient safety actions and items to predict risk situations, corrective actions, 
      and promote safety in emergency services and other health-related contexts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of quercetin on cell morphology and VEGF
      expression of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells NB4 in vitro. METHODS: The
      cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis rate by
      apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. RESULTS: Typical
      apoptosis was found in NB4 cells after treatment with quercetin. Apoptotic marker
      Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased
      after treatment with quercetin. The secretion of VEGF of NB4 cells was
      significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can
      induce apoptosis and inhibit secretion of VEGF in NB4 leukemia cells.

TI  - Peristomal skin care: an overview of available products.
PG  - 1048, 1050, 1052-4 passim
AB  - Intact skin provides a protective barrier between the body and its environment.
      The frequent application and removal of stoma appliances can damage skin by
      stripping away the epidermal layer. Hydrocolloid flanges in either a one- or
      two-piece appliance hold moisture in the mass and are therefore more skin
      friendly than older appliances with acrylic adhesives, making hydrocolloid the
      choice for ostomy appliance manufacturers. Peristomal skin problems are a
      significant problem for the stoma patient. As many as one third of colostomy
      patients and more than two thirds of ileostomy and urostomy patients will be
      affected (Lyons and Smith, 2003). The correct and judicial use of barrier creams,
      gels, lotions, sprays and wipes in peristomal skin care can play an important
      role in giving the stoma patient a good quality of life.

PG  - 473-91
LID - 10.1017/S0954579408000230 [doi]
AB  - Animal studies reveal that early deprivation impairs regulation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, potentially increasing
      vulnerability to stressors throughout life. To examine early deprivation effects 
      on basal HPA axis activity in humans, basal cortisol levels were examined in 164 
      internationally adopted children who had experienced varying degrees of
      preadoption deprivation. Duration of institutional care, age at adoption, and
      parent ratings of preadoption neglect indexed a latent factor of Deprived Care.
      Adoption measures of height and weight standardized to World Health Organisation 
      norms indexed a latent factor of Growth Delay that was viewed as another
      reflection of deprivation. Cortisol samples were collected 3.3-11.6 years
      postadoption (Md = 7.3 years) at home on 3 days approximately 30 min after wakeup
      and before bedtime. Both early a.m. levels and the decrease in cortisol across
      the day were examined. A structural equation model revealed that preadoption
      Deprived Care predicted Growth Delay at adoption and Growth Delay predicted
      higher morning cortisol levels and a larger diurnal cortisol decrease.

      (mOsm) and 284.66+/-30.18mOsm, respectively. After three months of contact lens
      wear, osmolarity values were found 317.74+/-60.23mOsm in group 1 and
      298.40+/-37.77mOsm in group 2. Although osmolarity values for both groups of SiH 
      contact lens wear after three months periods were slightly higher than before the
      contact lens wear, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: 
      Contact lens wear may cause evaporation from the tear film and can increase tear 
      film osmolarity leading to symptoms of dry eye disease. In the current study,
      there is a tendency to increase tear film osmolarity for both groups of SiH
      contact lens wear, but the difference is not statistically significant.

TI  - Low dose ketamine reduces the induction of ERK1/2 and CREB signaling protein in a
      neuropathic pain model of rats.
PG  - 210-216
LID - 10.4097/kjae.2009.57.2.210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to causing the loss of voluntary sensory and motor
      function, spinal cord injury (SCI) often creates a state of central neuropathic
      pain. Rats given SCI display increases in the activated form of transcription
      factors ERK 1/2 MAPK and CREB in the spinal cord, which correspond to allodynia
      in a model of neuropathic pain. This study was conducted to determine if low dose
      ketamine had an effect on the activation of ERK 1/2 and CREB in the development
      of neuropathic pain. METHODS: This study was conducted to evaluate ERK 1/2 and
      CREB protein in a sham operated (control) group, neuropathic pain and normal
      saline (NP + NS) group and neuropathic pain and ketamine (NP + Keta) group. To
      accomplish this, male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and then subjected to
      L5-L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL, neuropathic rats). The total amounts of ERK 1/2
      and CREB protein were then assessed by western blot analysis. In addition,
      changes in the amounts of ERK 1/2 and CREB mRNA were evaluated by RT-PCR.
      RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the amount of ERK 1/2 and CREB in
      the NP + NS group when compared with the sham group. However, the amount of ERK
      1/2 and CREB protein induced due to SNL were significantly reduced by continuous 
      infusion with ketamine in the NP + Keta group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
      study revealed a positive linkage between NMDA receptors and the ERK-CREB
      signaling pathway. Therefore, NMDA receptors could be the target of future
      therapeutic approaches. Additionally, the results of the present study provide
      additional evidence that low dose ketamine effectively prevents and treats
      central neuropathic pain following SNL.

TI  - Cyclin D1, retinoblastoma and p16 protein expression in carcinoma of the
      gallbladder.
PG  - 2711-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer of the gallbladder is a relatively rare neoplasm with a poor
      prognosis. The exact mechanisms of its genesis are not known and very little
      information is available on molecular events leading to labeling this as an
      orphan cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective case control study we
      evaluated the expression of p16, pRb and cyclin D1 by immunohistochemistry to
      study the G1-S cell-cycle check point and its possible role in gallbladder
      carcinogenesis. A total of 25 patients with gallbladder carcinoma (group I), 25
      with cholelithiasis (group II) and 10 normal controls. were enrolled. RESULTS:
      Cyclin D1 expression was seen in 10 (40%) patients each with carcinoma and
      cholelithiasis while only in 2 (20%) of the normal gallbladders but differences
      were not statistically significant (p value=0.488). p16 was expressed in 12%
      patients of carcinoma of the gallbladder and 28% of cholelithiasis, however this 
      difference was not statistically significant (p value=0.095). Retinoblastoma
      protein was found to be expressed in 50% of normal gallbladders and 6 (24%) of
      carcinoma and 8 (32%) of gallstones. The present study failed to demonstrate any 
      conclusive role of cyclin D1/RB/ p16 pathway in carcinoma of the gallbladder.
      CONCLUSIONS: The positive relation observed between tumor metastasis and cyclinD1
      expression and p16 with nodal metastasis suggested that higher cyclin D1/p16
      expression may act as a predictive biomarker for aggressive behavior of
      gallbladder malignancies.

TI  - Inhibition of influenza A virus by mixed siRNAs, targeting the PA, NP, and NS
      genes, delivered by hybrid microcarriers.

AB  - In the present study, a highly effective carrier system has been developed for
      the delivery of antiviral siRNA mixtures. The developed hybrid microcarriers,
      made of biodegradable polymers and SiO2 nanostructures, more efficiently mediate 
      cellular uptake of siRNA than commercially available liposome-based reagents and 
      polyethyleneimine (PEI); they also demonstrate low in vitro toxicity and
      protection of siRNA from RNase degradation. A series of siRNA designs (targeting 
      the most conserved regions of three influenza A virus (IAV) genes: NP, NS, and
      PA) were screened in vitro using RT-qPCR, ELISA analysis, and hemagglutination
      assay. Based on the results of screening, the three most effective siRNAs
      (PA-1630, NP-717, and NS-777) were selected for in situ encapsulation into hybrid
      microcarriers. It was revealed that pre-treatment of cells with a mixture of
      PA-1630, NP-717, and NS-777 siRNAs, delivered by hybrid microcarriers, provided
      stronger inhibition of viral M1 mRNA expression and control of NP protein level, 
      after viral infection, than single pre-treatment by any of three encapsulated
      siRNAs used in the study. Moreover, the effective inhibition of replication in
      several IAV subtypes (H1N1, H1N1pdm, H5N2, and H7N9) using a cocktail of the
      three selected siRNAs, delivered by our hybrid capsules to the cells, was
      achieved. In conclusion, we have developed a proof-of-principle which shows that 
      our hybrid microcarrier technology (utilizing a therapeutic siRNA cocktail) may
      represent a promising approach in anti-influenza therapy.

TI  - Prognostic value of alcohol dehydrogenase mRNA expression in gastric cancer.
PG  - 5505-5516
LID - 10.3892/ol.2018.8007 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have reported that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isoenzymes
      possess diagnostic value in gastric cancer (GC). However, the prognostic value of
      ADH isoenzymes in GC remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to
      identify the prognostic value of ADH genes in patients with GC. The prognostic
      value of ADH genes was investigated in patients with GC using the Kaplan-Meier
      plotter tool. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to assess the difference between
      groups of patients with GC with different prognoses. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the relative risk of GC survival.
      Overall, 593 patients with GC and 7 ADH genes were included in the survival
      analysis. High expression of ADH 1A (class 1), alpha polypeptide (ADH1A; log-rank
      P=0.043; HR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.64-0.99), ADH 1B (class 1), beta polypeptide (ADH1B; 
      log-rank P=1.9x10(-05); HR=0.65; 95% CI: 0.53-0.79) and ADH 5 (class III), chi
      polypeptide (ADH5; log-rank P=0.0011; HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.6-0.88) resulted in a
      significantly decreased risk of mortality in all patients with GC compared with
      patients with low expression of those genes. Furthermore, protective effects may 
      additionally be observed in patients with intestinal-type GC with high expression
      of ADH1B (log-rank P=0.031; HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.43-0.96) and patients with
      diffuse-type GC with high expression of ADH1A (log-rank P=0.014; HR=0.51; 95% CI:
      0.3-0.88), ADH1B (log-rank P=0.04; HR=0.53; 95% CI: 0.29-0.98), ADH 4 (class II),
      pi polypeptide (log-rank P=0.033; HR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.96) and ADH 6 (class V)
      (log-rank P=0.037; HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.35-0.97) resulting in a significantly
      decreased risk of mortality compared with patients with low expression of those
      genes. In contrast, patients with diffuse-type GC with high expression of ADH5
      (log-rank P=0.044; HR=1.66; 95% CI: 1.01-2.74) were significantly correlated with
      a poor prognosis. The results of the present study suggest that ADH1A and ADH1B
      may be potential prognostic biomarkers of GC, whereas the prognostic value of
      other ADH genes requires further investigation.

TI  - [Assessment of growth factor levels in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      and the beginning of diabetic microangiopathy].
PG  - 41-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was the evaluation of growth hormone (GH),
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein
      (IGFBP-3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in adolescents with type 
      1 diabetes as well as the relationship between the concentration of examined
      proteins and the early development of diabetic microangiopathy. RESEARCH DESIGN
      AND METHODS: The study included 68 patients aged 15.54+/-2.9 years with type 1
      diabetes. They were divided into groups: I - adolescents with the beginning of
      vascular complications, II - without complications. Controls consisted of healthy
      adolescents. GH, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and VEGF were determined with use of ready kits. 
      RESULTS: The increased levels of GH were found in diabetic adolescents in
      comparison with controls (10.11+/-16.21 vs. 2.89+/-4.03 micro IU/ml, p<0.05). The
      levels of IGF 1 were lower in adolescents with type 1 diabetes than in controls
      (283.48+/-117.36 vs. 427.95+/-177.48 ng/ml, p<0.05), as well as the levels of
      IGFBP-3 (5555.21+/-1158 vs. 6622.18+/-1110 pg/ml, p<0.05). Significantly higher
      concentration of VEGF was revealed in diabetic adolescents in comparison with
      controls (328.68+/-251 vs. 132.19+/-85 pg/ml, p<0.05). The highest levels of VEGF
      were reported in diabetic patients with retinopathy in comparison with patients
      without complications. CONCLUSIONS: The impaired activity of GH-IGF-1-IGFBP-3
      axis may be responsible for the development of diabetic microangiopathy. The
      evaluation of VEGF concentration can be a sensitive early marker of
      microangiopathy.

TI  - Impaired memory is more closely associated with brain beta-amyloid than
      leukoaraiosis in hypertensive patients with cognitive symptoms.
PG  - e0191345
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0191345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the strongest modifiable risk factor for subcortical 
      ischemic changes and is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's dementia. We used
      neuroimaging to investigate the pathological basis of early cognitive symptoms in
      patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this cross-sectional cohort study 67
      patients age >60 years with hypertension and Clinical Dementia Rating scale score
      of 0.5 without dementia, and without history of symptomatic stroke, underwent MRI
      for measurement of subcortical vascular changes and positron emission tomography 
      (PET) scan with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET) to detect beta-amyloid
      deposition. These imaging measures were related to neuropsychological tests of
      memory, executive function and processing speed. RESULTS: Mean age was 75.0
      (standard deviation, SD, 7.3). Mean neuropsychological Z scores were: episodic
      memory -0.63 (SD 1.23), executive function -0.40 (SD 1.10), processing speed
      -0.24 (SD 0.88); 22 of the 67 subjects met criteria for mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) and the remaining 45 subjects had subjective cognitive concerns only. In
      multivariable models adjusting for age and years of education, each 0.1 unit
      increase in mean cortical PiB-PET binding was associated with 0.14 lower mean Z
      score for episodic memory (95% CI -0.28 to -0.01). This means that for every 0.1 
      unit increase in mean cortical PiB-PET, episodic memory was 0.14 standard
      deviations lower. White matter hyperintensity volume, silent brain infarcts and
      microbleeds were not associated with neuropsychological test scores. CONCLUSIONS:
      Episodic memory was prominently affected in hypertensive participants with MCI or
      subjective cognitive concerns, and was associated with PiB-PET binding. This
      suggests a prominent role for Alzheimer pathology in cognitive impairment even in
      hypertensive participants at elevated risk for vascular cognitive impairment.

TI  - The effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate on laryngospasm after elective
      adenotonsillectomy surgery in children.
PG  - e15960
LID - 10.5812/aapm.15960 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laryngospasm is the protective reflex of tracheobronchial tree
      against secretions and hemorrhage. This reflex is more prevalent in
      adenotonsillectomy in the presence of light anesthesia, which can lead to
      obstruction of airway, complications, and mortality. Different methods have been 
      studied for preventing this complication; however, none of them could reliably
      prevent it. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to assess the effect of magnesium
      sulfate on laryngospasm and coughing after adenotonsillectomy. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Seventy children with three to 12 years of age and ASA classes I and II,
      who were candidates for adenotonsillectomy, were recruited in this randomized
      clinical trial. The study group received 15 mg/kg intravenous magnesium sulfate
      and the control group received 0.9% normal saline with the same volume, 2 minutes
      after tracheal intubation via intravenous infusion for 20 minutes. After removing
      the endotracheal tube in the recovery room, the patients were assessed at minutes
      zero, 15, and 30in terms of laryngospasm and coughing. The assessment was based
      on four-point scale of severity of these complications and saturation percentage 
      of arterial oxygen in operating and recovery room. After collecting the data,
      results were analyzed with the SPSS 16 software anda P value < 0.05 was
      considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Laryngospasm was not found in the 
      magnesium sulfate group; however, its incidencewas5.7% in the control group. The 
      incidence rates of coughs were 17.1% and 40% in the magnesium sulfate group and
      in the control group, respectively, which had no statistically significant
      differences. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous magnesium sulfate with dose of 15 mg/kg
      could not prevent laryngospasm and coughing after removal of the endotracheal
      tube in patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy; however, it reduced coughing and 
      laryngospasm in the magnesium sulfate group compared with the control group.

AB  - Glioblastomas exhibit a hierarchical cellular organization, suggesting that they 
      are driven by neoplastic stem cells that retain partial yet abnormal
      differentiation potential. Here, we show that a large subset of patient-derived
      glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) express high levels of Achaete-scute homolog 1
      (ASCL1), a proneural transcription factor involved in normal neurogenesis.
      ASCL1(hi) GSCs exhibit a latent capacity for terminal neuronal differentiation in
      response to inhibition of Notch signaling, whereas ASCL1(lo) GSCs do not.
      Increasing ASCL1 levels in ASCL1(lo) GSCs restores neuronal lineage potential,
      promotes terminal differentiation, and attenuates tumorigenicity. ASCL1 mediates 
      these effects by functioning as a pioneer factor at closed chromatin, opening new
      sites to activate a neurogenic gene expression program. Directing GSCs toward
      terminal differentiation may provide therapeutic applications for a subset of GBM
      patients and strongly supports efforts to restore differentiation potential in
      GBM and other cancers.

PG  - 1605-10
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e31822b3728 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies proposed that repeat head computed tomography (RHCT)
      is of no value in patients with a minimal head injury (MHI) and normal neurologic
      examination (NE). The goal of our study was to investigate the value of RHCT in
      patients with MHI with an abnormal NE. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of
      adult patients presenting to a Level I trauma center from July 2002 to December
      2006 with MHI was performed. Demographics, injury severity, and HCT findings were
      collected. Patients with an abnormal NE at the time of RHCT were divided into
      three subgroups: acute deterioration NE (AD-NE), persistently abnormal NE
      (PA-NE), and unknown NE (U-NE). Changes in the management and outcomes after RHCT
      were compared. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients had a MHI with an abnormal NE.
      Of those, seven (6.5%) had a change in management after RHCT. At the time of
      RHCT, 68 patients (63%) had a PA-NE, 21 AD-NE, and 18 U-NE. Six patients (29%)
      with AD-NE, 1 patient (6%) with an U-NE, and no patients with PA-NE required
      changes in management after RHCT. Compared with a RHCT, NE had higher positive
      and negative predictive values in determining the need for management changes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Of all patients with MHI with an abnormal NE at the time of RHCT,
      63% had a PA-NE. Although a RHCT is beneficial to patients with an acutely
      deteriorating or U-NE, it appears to be of little value in patients with a PA-NE.
      Compared with RHCT, serial NE may be a stronger predictor for the need for
      intervention in patients with MHI.

LID - 10.3109/00016489.2011.626794 [doi]
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography (CT) scan with three-dimensional (3D)
      reconstruction of the inner ear provides a more accurate image of the
      relationship of the electrode within the cochlear canal, with direct
      demonstration of electrode insertion depth in the cochlea in comparison with
      X-ray plain film. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the value of
      spiral CT scans with 3D reconstruction in determining the insertion site and
      depth of implanted cochlear implant electrodes. METHODS: A total of 172 cochlear 
      implant recipients were involved in this study. The implanted electrodes of all
      patients were examined by X-ray plain film, and 157 cochlear recipients were
      examined by spiral CT scans with axial 1 mm image slices. The data from the CT
      scans were transferred to a workstation for 3D reconstruction (direct volume
      rendering) of the inner ear. The pseudocolor technique was used to display the
      electrode. RESULTS: The insertion depth of the electrode could be evaluated
      indirectly by the X-ray plain film. In contrast, the stereoscopic images from a
      CT scan with 3D reconstruction of the inner ear demonstrated the shape, position,
      and insertion depth of the electrode more accurately.

TI  - Presentation and Survival of Gastric Cancer Patients at an Urban Academic
      Safety-Net Hospital.
PG  - 239-246
LID - 10.1007/s11605-018-3898-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is decreasing nationally but remains pervasive
      globally. We evaluated our experience with gastric cancer at a safety-net
      hospital with a substantial immigrant population. METHODS: Demographics,
      pathology, and treatment were analyzed for gastric adenocarcinoma at our
      institution (2004-2017). Chi-square analyses were performed for dependence of
      staging on demographics. Survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox
      regression analyses. RESULTS: We identified 249 patients (median age 65 years).
      Patients were predominantly born outside the USA or Canada (74.3%), non-white
      (70.7%), and federally insured (71.4%), and presented with late-stage disease
      (52.2%). Hispanic ethnicity, Central American birthplace, Medicaid insurance, and
      zip code poverty > 20% were associated with late-stage presentation (all p <
      0.05). Univariate analyses showed decreased survival for patients with late-stage
      disease, highest zip code poverty, and age >/= 65 (all p < 0.05). On multivariate
      analysis, survival was negatively associated with late-stage presentation (HR
      4.45, p < 0.001), age >/= 65 (1.80, p = 0.018), and H. pylori infection (2.02, p 
      = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Hispanic ethnicity, Central American birthplace, Medicaid
      insurance, and increased neighborhood poverty were associated with late-stage
      presentation of gastric cancer with poor outcomes. Further study of these
      populations may lead to screening protocols in order to increase earlier
      detection and improve survival.

PG  - e1198-204
LID - 10.1542/peds.2008-3704 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical characteristics of spinal deformities that commonly occur in 
      patients with esophageal atresia (EA) are unclear. The objective of this study
      was to assess the incidence and natural history of spinal anomalies and scoliosis
      in patients with EA. METHODS: A population-based cohort of 100 adults who had an 
      operation for EA in our hospital were examined clinically and radiographically
      for spinal deformities. The results were compared with data obtained from normal 
      population-based controls. RESULTS: Vertebral anomalies were observed in 45
      patients, predominating in the cervical spine in 38 patients. Any additional
      anomaly was the most significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR]: 27 [95% confidence
      interval (CI): 8-100]) for the occurrence of vertebral anomalies. Scoliosis of
      >10 degrees was observed in 56 patients, >20 degrees in 11 patients, and >45
      degrees in 1 patient. The risk for scoliosis of >10 degrees was 13-fold (OR: 13
      [95% CI: 8.3-21]), and the risk for scoliosis of >20 degrees was 38-fold (OR: 38 
      [95% CI: 14-106]) compared with those in the normal population.
      Thoracotomy-induced rib fusions (OR: 3.6 [95% CI: 0.7-19]) and other associated
      anomalies (OR: 2.1 [95% CI: 0.9-2.9]) were the strongest predictive factors for
      scoliosis. The general clinical course of spinal deformities was mild, and none
      of the patients had undergone spinal surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of scoliosis 
      is 13-fold after repair of EA in relation to general population. Nearly half of
      the patients have vertebral anomalies predominating in the cervical spine. Most
      of these deformities were not diagnosed primarily or during growth. Spinal
      surgery is rarely indicated.

LID - 10.2527/jas.2013-6986 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this experiment was to investigate oxidative injury and the
      development of an antioxidant system after early weaning in piglets. A total of
      40 piglets (Landracex Large White, weaned at 14 d after birth) were randomly
      slaughtered 0 (w0d), 1 (w1d), 3 (w3d), 5 (w5d), or 7 d (w7d; n = 8) after
      weaning. Concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine
      (8-OHdG), and protein carbonyl and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
      glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase were measured in plasma. Gene
      expressions of antioxidant enzymes were determined by quantitative reverse
      transcription PCR analysis. The mediation of transcription factor 65 (p65) and
      the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways by
      oxidative stress was determined by Western blot analysis. Results showed that the
      plasma MDA level was significantly higher at 3 d (P < 0.05) and that the protein 
      carbonyl level increased at 1, 3, and 5 d (P < 0.05) compared with w0d. In
      addition, early weaning suppressed the plasma activity of SOD at 1 d (P < 0.05)
      and reduced the GSH-Px activity at 3 d (P < 0.05). The expression results in the 
      jejunum indicate that the genes related to antioxidant enzymes were downregulated
      (P < 0.05) at 3 and 5 d after weaning. Uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2), which is
      considered to be a feedback regulation on reactive oxygen species generation,
      tended to decrease in the ileum (P < 0.05) after weaning. Tumor protein 53 (p53),
      which regulates reactive oxygen species generation, was enhanced (P < 0.05) in
      the jejunum after weaning. Meanwhile, early weaning suppressed p65 (at 3, 5, and 
      7 d; P < 0.05) and Nrf2 (at 5 and 7 d; P < 0.05) signals in the jejunum, which
      might feedback-regulate antioxidant gene expression and promote the development
      of the antioxidant system. Therefore, we speculate that weaning disrupted
      oxidative balance and caused oxidative injury in piglets, and this imbalance can 
      recover with the development of an antioxidant system via feedback regulation.

LID - 10.1136/vr.102892 [doi]
AB  - To describe the signalment, clinicopathological findings and outcome in dogs
      presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI) and skin lesions between November 2012 
      and March 2014, in whom cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) was
      suspected and renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) was histopathologically
      confirmed. The medical records of dogs with skin lesions and AKI, with
      histopathologically confirmed renal TMA, were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty
      dogs from across the UK were identified with clinicopathological findings
      compatible with CRGV. These findings included the following: skin lesions,
      predominantly affecting the distal extremities; AKI; and variably, anaemia,
      thrombocytopaenia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Known causes of AKI were excluded. The
      major renal histopathological finding was TMA. All thirty dogs died or were
      euthanised. Shiga toxin was not identified in the kidneys of affected dogs.
      Escherichia coli genes encoding shiga toxin were not identified in faeces from
      affected dogs. CRGV has previously been reported in greyhounds in the USA, a
      greyhound in the UK, without renal involvement, and a Great Dane in Germany. This
      is the first report of a series of non-greyhound dogs with CRGV and AKI in the
      UK. CRGV is a disease of unknown aetiology carrying a poor prognosis when
      azotaemia develops.

TI  - Diagnosis Protocol of Stomach Distemperament for Clinical Practice in Iranian
      Traditional Medicine: A Narrative Review.
PG  - 877-881
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) stomach is the important organ 
      in the body. Its disorders can affect other organs such as liver, heart and also 
      can cause depression. Stomach distemperaments can cause some disorders. The
      purpose of this study was to provide a diagnostic method of stomach
      distemperament for clinical practice. METHODS: In this study authoritative ITM
      books such as Canon of Avicenna, Zakhirah-E-Kharazm Shahi by Hakim Esmail
      Jorjani, Kamel al-Sina'ah al-Tibbiyah by Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi were
      assessed and symptoms and signs of stomach distemperament were collected.
      RESULTS: Stomach has some normal temperament. The imbalance in temperament and
      humor can cause distemperments. There are 12 types of stomach distemperament and 
      based on symptoms and signs a primary protocol is designed for diagnosis of
      stomach distemperament. CONCLUSION: There is no available guideline for gastric
      distemperamet diagnosis protocol. As a result, the presented protocol should be
      considered for use in clinical practice.

TI  - A monolithic radiation-pressure driven, low phase noise silicon nitride
      opto-mechanical oscillator.
PG  - 24522-9
LID - 10.1364/OE.19.024522 [doi]
AB  - Cavity opto-mechanics enabled radiation pressure (RP) driven oscillators shown in
      the past offer an all optical Radio Frequency (RF) source without the need for
      external electrical feedback. However these oscillators require external tapered 
      fiber or prism coupling and non-standard fabrication processes. In this work, we 
      present a CMOS compatible fabrication process to design high optical quality
      factor opto-mechanical resonators in silicon nitride. The ring resonators
      designed in this process demonstrate low phase noise RP driven oscillations.
      Using integrated grating couplers and waveguide to couple light to the
      micro-resonator eliminates 1/f(3) and other higher order phase noise slopes at
      close-to-carrier frequencies present in previous demonstrations. We present an RP
      driven opto-mechanical oscillator (OMO) operating at 41.97 MHz with a signal
      power of -11 dBm and phase noise of -85 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset with only 1/f(2)
      noise down to 10 Hz offset from carrier.

TI  - Efficient band gap prediction for solids.
PG  - 196403
AB  - An efficient method for the prediction of fundamental band gaps in solids using
      density functional theory (DFT) is proposed. Generalizing the Delta
      self-consistent-field (DeltaSCF) method to infinite solids, the Delta-sol method 
      is based on total-energy differences and derived from dielectric screening
      properties of electrons. Using local and semilocal exchange-correlation
      functionals (local density and generalized gradient approximations), we
      demonstrate a 70% reduction of mean absolute errors compared to Kohn-Sham gaps on
      over 100 compounds with experimental gaps of 0.5-4 eV, at computational costs
      similar to typical DFT calculations.

TI  - [Ultrasonographic diagnosis of cervical incompetence].
PG  - 518-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to verify clinical diagnosis of cervical
      incompetence by the use of transvaginal sonography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 101
      pregnant women hospitalized at the Pathological Pregnancy Department, Medical
      University of Lodz in years 2000-2002 because of suspicion of cervical
      incompetence were analysed. The mean age of examined group was 24 +/- 3.24 yr.
      All pregnant women underwent ultrasound cervical assessment at the 18-30 week of 
      gestation by using Hitachi EUB 515C system. Sonographic measurements of cervical 
      length and width were performed. The cervical length below 30 mm and width at
      least 6 mm were sonographic criteria of cervical incompetence. RESULTS: In 63
      pregnant women cervical incompetence was not confirmed by ultrasound examination.
      In 38 patients sonographic features of cervical incompetence were established. 38
      pregnant women were underwent elective cervical cerclage for cervical
      incompetence. Because of poor previous history 8 women with normal ultrasound
      examination were treated by cervical cerclage. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude, that
      clinical diagnosis of cervical incompetence should be verified by the use of
      transvaginal sonography to provide an objective diagnosis.

TI  - Cerebellar atrophy is infrequently [corrected] associated with non-paraneoplastic
      sensory neuronopathy.
PG  - 602-6
LID - S0004-282X2011000500006 [pii]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Sensory neuronopathies (SN) are peripheral nervous system disorders
      associated with degeneration of dorsal root ganglion neurons. Despite the
      evidence of a defective proprioceptive sensory input in SN,the prominent gait and
      truncal ataxia raises the question of a concomitant involvement of the
      cerebellum. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cerebellar atrophy in SN. METHOD: We analyzed 
      MRI-based volumetry of anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) and total cerebellum in
      patients with non-paraneoplastic chronic SN and compared to age- and
      gender-matched controls. RESULTS: Cerebellum and anterior lobe MRI volumetry were
      performed in 20 patients and nine controls. Mean anterior lobe and cerebellar
      volume were not statistically different. Three patients (15%), however, had an
      abnormal anterior lobe and cerebellar volume index (values outside 2.5 standard
      deviations). One of them also had a specific atrophy of the anterior lobe. All
      these patients had infectious or dysimmune associated SN. CONCLUSION: Cerebellar 
      atrophy is infrequently associated with SN, but can be found in some patients
      with SN related to infectious or immune mediated conditions. It can be more
      prominent in the anterior lobe and may contribute to the ataxia seen in these
      patients.

TI  - Dietary Leucine Supplementation Improves the Mucin Production in the Jejunal
      Mucosa of the Weaned Pigs Challenged by Porcine Rotavirus.

AB  - The present study was mainly conducted to determine whether dietary leucine
      supplementation could attenuate the decrease of the mucin production in the
      jejunal mucosa of weaned pigs infected by porcine rotavirus (PRV). A total of 24 
      crossbred barrows weaned at 21 d of age were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 diets
      supplemented with 1.00% L-leucine or 0.68% L-alanine (isonitrogenous control) for
      17 d. On day 11, all pigs were orally infused PRV or the sterile essential
      medium. During the first 10 d of trial, dietary leucine supplementation could
      improve the feed efficiency (P = 0.09). The ADG and feed efficiency were impaired
      by PRV infusion (P<0.05). PRV infusion also increased mean cumulative score of
      diarrhea, serum rotavirus antibody concentration and crypt depth of the jejunal
      mucosa (P<0.05), and decreased villus height: crypt depth (P = 0.07), goblet cell
      numbers (P<0.05), mucin 1 and 2 concentrations (P<0.05) and phosphorylated mTOR
      level (P<0.05) of the jejunal mucosa in weaned pigs. Dietary leucine
      supplementation could attenuate the effects of PRV infusion on feed efficiency (P
      = 0.09) and mean cumulative score of diarrhea (P = 0.09), and improve the effects
      of PRV infusion on villus height: crypt depth (P = 0.06), goblet cell numbers
      (P<0.05), mucin 1 (P = 0.08) and 2 (P = 0.07) concentrations and phosphorylated
      mTOR level (P = 0.08) of the jejunal mucosa in weaned pigs. These results suggest
      that dietary 1% leucine supplementation alleviated the decrease of mucin
      production and goblet cell numbers in the jejunal mucosa of weaned pigs
      challenged by PRV possibly via activation of the mTOR signaling.

LID - 10.1002/sim.6220 [doi]
AB  - Longitudinal data are often segmented by unobserved time-varying factors, which
      introduce latent heterogeneity at the observation level, in addition to
      heterogeneity across subjects. We account for this latent structure by a linear
      mixed hidden Markov model. It integrates subject-specific random effects and
      Markovian sequences of time-varying effects in the linear predictor. We propose
      an expectationU-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, based
      on data augmentation. It reduces to the iterative maximization of the expected
      value of a complete likelihood function, derived from an augmented dataset with
      case weights, alternated with weights updating. In a case study of the Survey on 
      Stress Aging and Health in Russia, the model is exploited to estimate the
      influence of the observed covariates under unobserved time-varying factors, which
      affect the cardiovascular activity of each subject during the observation period.

TI  - Repeat ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - Does adenosine play a role
      in predicting pulmonary vein reconnection patterns?
PG  - 203-207

LID - 10.1016/j.ipej.2018.09.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein (PV) reconduction after PV isolation (PVI) unmasked by
      adenosine is associated with a higher risk for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      (PAF) recurrence. It is unknown if the reconnected PVs after adenosine testing
      and immediate re-ablation can predict reconnection and reconnection patterns of
      PVs at repeat procedures. We assessed reconnection of PVs with and without
      dormant-conduction (DC) during the first and the repeat procedure. METHODS: We
      included 67 patients undergoing PVI for PAF and a second procedure for PAF
      recurrence. DC during adenosine administration at first procedure was seen in 31 
      patients (46%). 264 PVs were tested with adenosine; DC was found in 48PVs (18%)
      and re-ablated during first procedure. During the second procedure, all PVs where
      checked for reconnection. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (87%) showed PV
      reconnection during the second procedure. Reconnection was found in 152/264PVs
      (58%). Of 216PVs without reconnection during adenosine testing at the first
      ablation, 116PVs (53.7%) showed reconnection at the repeat procedure. Overall,
      14.9% of patients showed the same PV reconnection pattern in the first and second
      procedure, expected statistical probability of encountering the same reconnection
      pattern was only 6.6%(p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In repeat procedures PVs showed
      significantly more often the same reconnection pattern as during first procedure 
      than statistically expected. More than 50% of initial isolated PVs without
      reconnection during adenosine testing showed a reconnection during repeat
      ablation. Techniques to detect susceptibility for PV re-connection like prolonged
      waiting-period should be applied. Elimination of DC should be expanded from
      segmental to circumferential re-isolation or vaster RF application.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Incidence and prevalence of epilepsy increase with advancing age.
      Although the majority of late-onset epilepsies are of lesional origin, a
      considerable proportion of patients present with unknown etiology. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the semiological, electroencephalographic (EEG), and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics as well as the 12-month seizure outcome
      in a cohort of patients with nonlesional late-onset epilepsy (>/=55years).
      METHOD: A total of 54 patients with newly diagnosed nonlesional late-onset
      epilepsy (NLLOE) were retrospectively evaluated for seizure type using the most
      recent International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of seizure
      types, EEG characteristics, and CSF profile and followed-up for at least 12months
      after epilepsy onset. Results were compared with a gender-matched control group
      of 58 patients with nonlesional early-onset epilepsy (NLEOE). RESULTS: The
      predominant seizure types in NLLOE were focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures 
      (30%) as well as focal onset impaired awareness motor seizures (IAMS) (22%) and
      focal onset impaired awareness nonmotor seizures (IANMS) (22%). The predominant
      seizure types in NLEOE were focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (43%) as
      well as focal onset aware nonmotor seizures (ANMS) (31%) and IAMS (31%). Focal
      onset impaired awareness nonmotor seizures were found to be more characteristic
      in patients with NLLOE (p=0.019; alpha<0.05; NLLOE: 22.2% vs. NLEOE: 8.6%).
      Electroencephalography revealed no significant differences between groups. Of
      interest, three patients with NLLOE (8%) presented with oligoclonal bands (OCB)
      in CSF albeit absence of antineuronal antibodies. Seizure-free rate was 70%.
      Adverse effects from medication leading to antiepileptic drug (AED) change were
      reported in 12 patients (22%), valproate was the best tolerated AED in patients
      with NLLOE [adverse effects in 9%, compared with 12% (gabapentin) and 26%
      (levetiracetam)]. CONCLUSIONS: Using the most recent classification system,
      different patterns of semiological characteristics were identified: NLLOE more
      frequently present with IANMS, whereas patients with NLEOE rather have ANMS.
      Oligoclonal bands were only detected in patients with NLLOE, indicating that
      careful exclusion of autoimmune encephalitis in this patient group is warranted. 
      Our findings may help to more accurately identify and characterize patients with 
      NLLOE to improve targeted diagnostics and adequate treatment in this challenging 
      group of patients.

TI  - Stereotactic brain biopsy: An audit of sampling reliability in a clinical case
      series.
PG  - 222-6
AB  - Stereotactic brain biopsy is the current gold standard procedure to obtain a
      neuropathological diagnosis. An audit of 207 stereotactic cases, between January 
      1997 and December 2000 was carried out. The aim was to determine the optimum
      number of target sites required to make the final diagnosis and thereby set up
      recommendations for future practice. The overall diagnostic success rate was
      89.3%. A significant positive correlation between the number of targets taken and
      the probability of achieving the final diagnosis was seen. In a subset of
      glioblastoma cases 96.1% of the tumours could have been confidently diagnosed on 
      the basis of any two of the targets chosen, although often more targets were
      taken than this. The recommendations made by the audit were: (i) in cases where
      it is suspected the lesion does not require grading, one target site should be
      taken and further sites should only be taken if the first proves to be non
      diagnostic; (ii) in suspected glial series tumours, two targets should be
      routinely taken, with further sites taken only if these prove inconclusive on
      intraoperative smear.

TI  - Relational Learning and Network Modelling Using Infinite Latent Attribute Models.
PG  - 462-74
LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2324586 [doi]
AB  - Latent variable models for network data extract a summary of the relational
      structure underlying an observed network. The simplest possible models subdivide 
      nodes of the network into clusters; the probability of a link between any two
      nodes then depends only on their cluster assignment. Currently available models
      can be classified by whether clusters are disjoint or are allowed to overlap.
      These models can explain a "flat" clustering structure. Hierarchical Bayesian
      models provide a natural approach to capture more complex dependencies. We
      propose a model in which objects are characterised by a latent feature vector.
      Each feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups (subclusters),
      corresponding to a second layer of hierarchy. In experimental comparisons, the
      model achieves significantly improved predictive performance on social and
      biological link prediction tasks. The results indicate that models with a single 
      layer hierarchy over-simplify real networks.

TI  - Posterior insular cortex - a site of vestibular-somatosensory interaction?
PG  - 519-24
LID - 10.1002/brb3.155 [doi]
AB  - Background In previous imaging studies the insular cortex (IC) has been
      identified as an essential part of the processing of a wide spectrum of
      perception and sensorimotor integration. Yet, there are no systematic lesion
      studies in a sufficient number of patients examining whether processing of
      vestibular and the interaction of somatosensory and vestibular signals take place
      in the IC. Methods We investigated acute stroke patients with lesions affecting
      the IC in order to fill this gap. In detail, we explored signs of a vestibular
      tone imbalance such as the deviation of the subjective visual vertical (SVV). We 
      applied voxel-lesion behaviour mapping analysis in 27 patients with acute
      unilateral stroke. Results Our data demonstrate that patients with lesions of the
      posterior IC have an abnormal tilt of SVV. Furthermore, re-analysing data of 20
      patients from a previous study, we found a positive correlation between thermal
      perception contralateral to the stroke and the severity of the SVV tilt.
      Conclusions We conclude that the IC is a sensory brain region where different
      modalities might interact.

TI  - A Comparison of Factors Associated with Cessation of Exclusive Breastfeeding at 3
      and 6 Months.
PG  - 430-435
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2017.0045 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To analyze the association of labor and sociodemographic factors with
      cessation of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) at 3 and 6 months of life. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study (n = 529) was performed in a tertiary
      hospital with the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) award. Labor and
      sociodemographic factors were investigated. Single-term newborns were included.
      After 3 and 6 months, telephone calls were made to determine the type of
      lactation. Univariate analysis was performed with the chi-square test or Fisher's
      exact test. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to determine 
      risk factors associated with cessation of breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months.
      RESULTS: At 3 months, 523 participants (98.9%) were contacted, of whom 64.4%
      maintained EBF. Factors associated with cessation were pacifier use (odds ratio
      [OR] 3.49; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.24-5.43), cesarean delivery (OR
      4.49; 95% CI 2.96-6.83), no college degree (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.35-3.01), and not
      attending breastfeeding support groups (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.22-3.12). At 6 months, 
      512 participants (96.8%) were contacted, of whom 31.4% maintained EBF. Factors
      associated with cessation were reintegration into the workplace (OR 4.49; 95% CI 
      2.96-6.83), pacifier use (OR 3.49; 95% CI 2.24-5.43), and primiparity (OR 1.61;
      95% CI 1.05-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: Several risk factors are associated with the
      premature cessation of EBF. There is a need to define strategies to correct
      modifiable factors and to promote protective factors with the aim of improving
      the success rate of EBF to reach the recommendations of the World Health
      Organization.

TI  - Preweaning piglet mortality in relation to placental efficiency.
PG  - 144-51
AB  - The relationship between placental efficiency (PLEFF, i.e., the ratio of birth
      weight [BWB] to placental weight [PLW]) and neonatal pig vitality as measured by 
      the probability of preweaning death of live born piglets was examined for 1,036
      live born piglets of 118 litters. The data were first analyzed to establish
      whether the relationships between PLEFF, PLW, and BWB were affected by parity
      (first vs. higher). Furthermore, the data collected were used to establish
      whether PLEFF is a better predictor of the risk of neonatal pig mortality before 
      weaning than BWB and PLW. The relationships of BWB to PLW and PLEFF to PLW
      differed (P <0.01 and P <0.05, respectively) between piglets from gilts and sows.
      This difference appeared to be due mainly to an additional population of piglets 
      with very large placentas in sows that were not present in gilts. Despite being
      significant, the courses of the relationships were essentially similar for
      piglets in gilts and in sows. For the curvilinear relationship of BWB to PLW, up 
      to a certain threshold value, an increase of PLW resulted in an increase in BWB, 
      and thereafter BWB did not change. A consequence of this is that PLEFF at
      relatively high PLW does not give the same information as PLEFF at relatively low
      PLW. For the second-order relationship of PLEFF to BWB, PLEFF increased with an
      increase in BWB, until BWB = 1,657 g, and decreased thereafter. The PLEFF
      decreased linearly with PLW. A change in PLW had a much larger impact on the
      value of PLEFF than a change in BWB. Although BWB and PLW were negatively
      associated with the chance of dying before weaning (P <0.001 and P <0.01,
      respectively), only PLEFF tended to be negatively associated with the chance of
      dying only before weaning (P = 0.08). Its underlying trait, BWB, played a greater
      role on the effect of PLEFF on the chance of preweaning death than PLW. In
      conclusion, PLEFF in swine is a complicated trait that should be treated with
      care. It is merely a mathematical derivative of BWB and PLW, whereby the extent
      to which BWB depends on PLW depends on the value of PLW. Placental functioning
      and fetal growth capacity, however, also have their effects on the value of BWB. 
      It is concluded that, of the three traits (BWB, PLW, and PLEFF), the best
      predictor for the chance of preweaning mortality, which also happens to be
      easiest to measure, remains BWB.

PG  - 13240-50
LID - 10.1021/ja802215c [doi]
AB  - The nucleotidyl-transfer reaction coupled with the conformational transitions in 
      DNA polymerases is critical for maintaining the fidelity and efficiency of DNA
      synthesis. We examine here the possible reaction pathways of a Y-family DNA
      polymerase, Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4), for the correct
      insertion of dCTP opposite 8-oxoguanine using the quantum mechanics/molecular
      mechanics (QM/MM) approach, both from a chemistry-competent state and a crystal
      closed state. The latter examination is important for understanding pre-chemistry
      barriers to interpret the entire enzyme mechanism, since the crystal closed state
      is not an ideal state for initiating the chemical reaction. The most favorable
      reaction path involves initial deprotonation of O3'H via two bridging water
      molecules to O1A, overcoming an overall potential energy barrier of approximately
      20.0 kcal/mol. The proton on O1A-P(alpha) then migrates to the gamma-phosphate
      oxygen of the incoming nucleotide as O3' attacks P(alpha), and the P(alpha)-O3A
      bond breaks. The other possible pathway in which the O3'H proton is transferred
      directly to O1A on P(alpha) has an overall energy barrier of 25.0 kcal/mol. In
      both reaction paths, the rate-limiting step is the initial deprotonation, and the
      trigonal-bipyramidal configuration for P(alpha) occurs during the concerted bond 
      formation (O3'-P(alpha)) and breaking (P(alpha)-O3A), indicating the associative 
      nature of the chemical reaction. In contrast, the Dpo4/DNA complex with an
      imperfect active-site geometry corresponding to the crystal state must overcome a
      much higher activation energy barrier (29.0 kcal/mol) to achieve a tightly
      organized site due to hindered O3'H deprotonation stemming from larger distances 
      and distorted conformation of the proton acceptors. This significant difference
      demonstrates that the pre-chemistry reorganization in Dpo4 costs approximately
      4.0 to 9.0 kcal/mol depending on the primer terminus environment. Compared to the
      higher fidelity DNA polymerase beta from the X-family, Dpo4 has a higher chemical
      reaction barrier (20.0 vs 15.0 kcal/mol) due to the more solvent-exposed active
      site.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic patients with depression are often inadequately treated
      within primary care. These comorbid conditions are associated with poor outcomes.
      The aim of this systematic review was to examine whether collaborative care can
      improve depression and diabetes outcomes in patients with both depression and
      diabetes. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane library and PsyINFO were
      systematically searched to identify relevant publications. All randomized
      controlled trials of collaborative care for diabetic patients with depression of 
      all ages who were reported by depression treatment response, depression
      remission, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, adherence to antidepressant medication 
      and/or oral hypoglycemic agent were included. Two authors independently screened 
      search results and extracted data from eligible studies. Dichotomous and
      continuous measures of outcomes were combined using risk ratios (RRs) and mean
      differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) either by fixed or
      random-effects models. RESULTS: Eight studies containing 2,238 patients met the
      inclusion criteria. Collaborative care showed a significant improvement in
      depression treatment response (RR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68), depression
      remission (adjusted RR = 1.53, 95% CI =1.11-2.12), higher rates of adherence to
      antidepressant medication (RR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.19-2.69) and oral hypoglycemic
      agent (RR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.61-2.96), but indicated a non-significant reduction 
      in HbA1c values (MD = -0.13, 95% CI = -0.46-0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Improving
      depression care in diabetic patients is very necessary and important. Comparing
      with usual care, collaborative care was associated with significantly better
      depressive outcomes and adherence in patients with depression and diabetes. These
      findings emphasize the implications for collaborative care of diabetic patients
      with depression in the future.

TI  - The intrinsic protein flexibility of endogenous protease inhibitor TIMP-1
      controls its binding interface and affects its function.
PG  - 6184-92
LID - 10.1021/bi902141x [doi]
AB  - Protein flexibility is thought to play key roles in numerous biological
      processes, including antibody affinity maturation, signal transduction, and
      enzyme catalysis, yet only limited information is available regarding the
      molecular details linking protein dynamics with function. A single point mutation
      at the distal site of the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1
      (TIMP-1) enables this clinical target protein to tightly bind and inhibit
      membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) by increasing only the
      association constant. The high-resolution X-ray structure of this complex
      determined at 2 A could not explain the mechanism of enhanced binding and pointed
      to a role for protein conformational dynamics. Molecular dynamics (MD)
      simulations reveal that the high-affinity TIMP-1 mutants exhibit significantly
      reduced binding interface flexibility and more stable hydrogen bond networks.
      This was accompanied by a redistribution of the ensemble of substrates to
      favorable binding conformations that fit the enzyme catalytic site. Apparently,
      the decrease in backbone flexibility led to a lower entropy cost upon formation
      of the complex. This work quantifies the effect of a single point mutation on the
      protein conformational dynamics and function of TIMP-1. Here we argue that
      controlling the intrinsic protein dynamics of MMP endogenous inhibitors may be
      utilized for rationalizing the design of selective novel protein inhibitors for
      this class of enzymes.

TI  - Simultaneous measurement of macro- and microvascular blood flow and oxygen
      saturation for quantification of muscle oxygen consumption.
PG  - 846-855
LID - 10.1002/mrm.26744 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between blood flow and oxygen
      consumption in skeletal muscle, a technique called "Velocity and Perfusion,
      Intravascular Venous Oxygen saturation and T2*" (vPIVOT) is presented. vPIVOT
      allows the quantification of feeding artery blood flow velocity, perfusion,
      draining vein oxygen saturation, and muscle T2*, all at 4-s temporal resolution. 
      Together, the measurement of blood flow and oxygen extraction can yield muscle
      oxygen consumption ( V O2) via the Fick principle. METHODS: In five subjects,
      vPIVOT-derived results were compared with those obtained from stand-alone
      sequences during separate ischemia-reperfusion paradigms to investigate the
      presence of measurement bias. Subsequently, in 10 subjects, vPIVOT was applied to
      assess muscle hemodynamics and V O2 following a bout of dynamic plantar flexion
      contractions. RESULTS: From the ischemia-reperfusion paradigm, no significant
      differences were observed between data from vPIVOT and comparison sequences.
      After exercise, the macrovascular flow response reached a maximum 8 +/- 3 s after
      relaxation; however, perfusion in the gastrocnemius muscle continued to rise for 
      101 +/- 53 s. Peak V O2 calculated based on mass-normalized arterial blood flow
      or perfusion was 15.2 +/- 6.7 mL O2 /min/100 g or 6.0 +/- 1.9 mL O2 /min/100 g,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: vPIVOT is a new method to measure blood flow and
      oxygen saturation, and therefore to quantify muscle oxygen consumption. Magn

TI  - Nuclear bile acid signaling through the farnesoid X receptor.
PG  - 1631-50
LID - 10.1007/s00018-014-1805-y [doi]
AB  - Bile acids (BAs) are amphipathic molecules produced from cholesterol by the
      liver. Expelled from the gallbladder upon meal ingestion, BAs serve as fat
      solubilizers in the intestine. BAs are reabsorbed in the ileum and return via the
      portal vein to the liver where, together with nutrients, they provide signals to 
      coordinate metabolic responses. BAs act on energy and metabolic homeostasis
      through the activation of membrane and nuclear receptors, among which the nuclear
      receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an important regulator of several
      metabolic pathways. Highly expressed in the liver and the small intestine, FXR
      contributes to BA effects on metabolism, inflammation and cell cycle control. The
      pharmacological modulation of its activity has emerged as a potential therapeutic
      strategy for liver and metabolic diseases. This review highlights recent advances
      regarding the mechanisms by which the BA sensor FXR contributes to global
      signaling effects of BAs, and how FXR activity may be regulated by
      nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways.

TI  - Nutrient restriction induces failure of reproductive function and molecular
      changes in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in postpubertal gilts.
PG  - 4733-42
LID - 10.1007/s11033-014-3344-x [doi]
AB  - People on a diet to lose weight may be at risk of reproductive failure. To
      investigate the effects of nutrient restriction on reproductive function and the 
      underlying mechanism, changes of reproductive traits, hormone secretions and gene
      expressions in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis were examined in postpubertal 
      gilts at anestrus induced by nutrient restriction. Gilts having experienced two
      estrus cycles were fed a normal (CON, 2.86 kg/d) or nutrient restricted (NR, 1
      kg/d) food regimens to expect anestrus. NR gilts experienced another three estrus
      cycles, but did not express estrus symptoms at the anticipated fourth estrus.
      Blood samples were collected at 5 days' interval for consecutive three times for 
      measurement of hormone concentrations at the 23th day of the fourth estrus cycle.
      Individual progesterone concentrations of NR gilts from three consecutive blood
      samples were below 1.0 ng/mL versus 2.0 ng/mL in CON gilts, which was considered 
      anestrus. NR gilts had impaired development of reproductive tract characterized
      by absence of large follicles (diameter >/= 6 mm), decreased number of corepus
      lutea and atrophy of uterus and ovary tissues. Circulating concentrations of
      IGF-I, kisspeptin, estradiol, progesterone and leptin were significantly lower in
      NR gilts than that in CON gilts. Nutrient restriction down-regulated gene
      expressions of kiss-1, G-protein coupled protein 54, gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone, estrogen receptor alpha, progesterone receptor, leptin receptor,
      follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone and insulin-like growth
      factor I in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis of gilts. Collectively, nutrient 
      restriction resulted in impairment of reproductive function and changes of
      hormone secretions and gene expressions in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis,
      which shed light on the underlying mechanism by which nutrient restriction
      influenced reproductive function.

AB  - Hydrolysis/dehydration/aldol-condensation/hydrogenation of
      lignocellulosic-biomass (corncobs) and biomass-derived carbohydrates (tapioca
      flour) to produce water-soluble C5-C15 compounds was developed in a single
      reactor system. WO3-ZrO2 efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis/dehydration of
      these feedstocks to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural, while the impregnation 
      of WO3-ZrO2 with Pd allowed sequential aldolcondensation/hydrogenation of these
      furans to C5-C15 compounds. The highest C5-C15 yields of 14.8-20.3% were observed
      at a hydrolysis/dehydration temperature of 573 K for 5 min, an aldol-condensation
      temperature of 353 K for 30 h, and a hydrogenation temperature of 393 K for 6 h. 
      The C5-C15 yield from tapioca flour was higher than that from corncobs (20.3%
      compared to 14.8%). Tapioca flour produced more C6/C9/C15, whereas corncobs
      generated more C5/C8/C13 compounds due to the presence of hemicellulose in the
      corncobs. These water-soluble organic compounds can be further converted to
      liquid alkanes with high cetane numbers for replacing diesel fuel in
      transportation applications.

TI  - Post-transcriptional gene silencing in the root system of the actinorhizal tree
      Allocasuarina verticillata.
PG  - 518-24
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-21-5-0518 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, RNA interference has been exploited as a tool for investigating 
      gene function in plants. We tested the potential of double-stranded RNA
      interference technology for silencing a transgene in the actinorhizal tree
      Allocasuarina verticillata. The approach was undertaken using stably transformed 
      shoots expressing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene under the control of the
      constitutive promoter 35S; the shoots were further transformed with the
      Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4RS containing hairpin RNA (hpRNA) directed toward the 
      GUS gene, and driven by the 35S promoter. The silencing and control vectors
      contained the reporter gene of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), thus allowing
      a screening of GUS-silenced composite plantlets for autofluorescence. With this
      rapid procedure, histochemical data established that the reporter gene was
      strongly silenced in both fluorescent roots and actinorhizal nodules.
      Fluorometric data further established that the level of GUS silencing was usually
      greater than 90% in the hairy roots containing the hairpin GUS sequences. We
      found that the silencing process of the reporter gene did not spread to the
      aerial part of the composite A. verticillata plants. Real-time quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction showed that GUS mRNAs were substantially reduced in
      roots and, thereby, confirmed the knock-down of the GUS transgene in the GFP(+)
      hairy roots. The approach described here will provide a versatile tool for the
      rapid assessment of symbiotically related host genes in actinorhizal plants of
      the Casuarinaceae family.

TI  - Analysis of veterinary drug residues in cheese by ultra-high-performance LC
      coupled to triple quadrupole MS/MS.
PG  - 1223-30
LID - 10.1002/jssc.201201003 [doi]
AB  - A simple, reliable, and fast multiresidue method has been developed for the
      determination of 17 veterinary drugs belonging to several families (macrolides,
      sulfonamides, and anthelmintics) in cheese at trace levels.
      Ultra-high-performance LC coupled to MS/MS has been used for the analysis of
      these compounds in less than 9 min. Veterinary drug residues have been extracted 
      from cheese samples using a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and 
      safe)-based extraction procedure without applying any further clean-up step.
      Matrix-matched calibration was used for quantification and recoveries were
      calculated at three concentration levels (10, 50, and 100 mug/kg). The obtained
      values ranged from 70 to 110% for the selected compounds except for tylosin and
      josamycin at 100 mug/kg (111.7 and 112.7%, respectively). Intra- and interday
      precision were also evaluated and RSDs were lower than 25% in all the cases. LOQs
      ranged from 0.3 mug/kg (for thiabendazole, oxfendazole, mebendazole, josamycin,
      and fenbendazole) to 10.5 mug/kg (abamectin), whereas decision limit and
      detection capability ranged from 2.3 (thiabendazole) to 11.3 (abamectin) and 4.2 
      (thiabendazole) to 14.3 mug/kg (abamectin), respectively. Finally, 13 samples
      were analyzed and traces of thiabendazole were detected in two different cheeses.

TI  - Sociological dimension in the handling habit and sanitary quality of hand-dug
      well water from oil-producing area of Nigeria.
PG  - 255-61
AB  - A previous report showed that the physical and sanitary quality of hand-dug wells
      from an oil-producing area of Nigeria was poor in spite of the presence of well
      protective features. The hypothesis that handling habits is associated with the
      well water quality was therefore, tested. A structured questionnaire with scales 
      for measuring handling habits was administered to 60 female (>18 years) hand-dug 
      well users/owners randomly selected from three towns in the oil-producing area.
      The respondents' wells were analysed for coliform bacteria. The findings showed
      that poor handling habits were the trend (habit score: Mean, 9.23 vs. 20 total
      available points). Handling habit indicated by scores, significantly negatively
      correlated (-0.89; P < 0.01) with coliform counts (indicator of poor sanitary
      quality). While the data collected and discussions with respondents indicated
      awareness of the risk of drinking well water, widespread skepticism of the
      potential hazards of non-drinking domestic uses (e.g., cooking, washing of
      plates, cups, cutleries etc.) was evident. Discontent with some aspects of
      science was indicated. It is concluded that there is need for social discourse
      and more public health campaign aimed at transforming skepticism to consent.

TI  - Use of home care services effectively reduces feelings of burden among family
      caregivers of disabled elderly in Japan: preliminary results.
PG  - 163-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relatively few observational studies have been conducted on the
      impact of home care services on burden or other aspects of the caregiver's
      experience. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the use of care services reduces the
      feelings of burden among family caregivers in Japan. Specifically, the study was 
      aimed at testing the following three hypotheses: (1) The severity of impairment
      and the dementia among the disabled elderly increases the feelings of burden
      among family caregivers and the support from family members decreases burden: (2)
      the amount of services used by older people and their caregivers is affected by
      the severity of dementia and ADL deficiencies among the disabled elderly and the 
      amount of support from family members: and (3) controlling for severity, the use 
      of care services under the LTC insurance program serves to reduce the feelings of
      burden among family caregivers. METHODS: A structural equation model using the
      data obtained from 82 pairs of community-dwelling disabled elderly and their
      principal family caregivers. The model included the following variables: age of
      the disabled elderly; the severity of ADL deficiency and behavioral disturbances;
      use of formal (public) care services; support from family members; and feelings
      of burden among family caregivers. RESULTS: The structural equation model
      revealed that, after controlling for the effects of severity on service use, home
      care services effectively reduce feelings of burden among family caregivers.
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that care services provided under the LTC
      insurance have been successfully reducing burden among family caregivers in the
      study area.

TI  - Estimation of restraint stress in rats using salivary amylase activity.
PG  - 421-7
LID - 10.1007/s12576-012-0219-6 [doi]
AB  - The rat is an ideal model animal for studying physical and psychological
      stresses. Recent human studies have shown that salivary amylase activity is a
      useful biomarker of stress in our social life. To estimate the usefulness of
      amylase activity as a biomarker of stress in rats, we analyzed changes in
      physiological parameters including amylase activity and anatomical variables,
      which were induced by a mild restraint of paws (10 min, 3 times/week, 9 weeks).
      The quantities of food and water intake and excretion amount of the stress rats
      were smaller than those of the control rats during the experimental period (5-13 
      weeks). The body weight of the stress rats decreased compared with that of the
      control rats. Moreover, the enlargement of the adrenal gland was confirmed in the
      stress rats, indicating that the mild restraint caused a chronic stress response.
      The amylase activities of the stress rats were significantly greater than those
      of the control rats at 5 weeks of age. However, the amylase activity of the
      stress rats decreased compared with that of the control rats after 6 weeks of
      age. These results indicate that amylase activity is increased by acute stress
      and reduced by chronic stress, which is caused by repeated restraint stress. In
      conclusion, amylase activity is a useful biomarker of acute and chronic stresses 
      in rats.

TI  - Prospects for the gene therapy of spinal muscular atrophy.
PG  - 259-65
LID - 10.1016/j.molmed.2011.01.002 [doi]
AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by a deficiency
      of functional SMN protein because of mutations in SMN1. A decrease in SMN
      activity results in motor neuron cell loss in the spinal cord, leading to a
      weakness of the proximal muscles responsible for crawling, walking, head/neck
      control and swallowing as well as the involuntary muscles that control breathing 
      and coughing. Thus, patients present with pulmonary manifestations, paralysis and
      a shortened lifespan. Gene therapy is emerging as a promising therapeutic
      strategy for SMA given that the molecular basis for this monogenic disorder is
      well established. Recent advances and findings from preclinical studies in animal
      models provide optimism that gene therapy might be an effective therapeutic
      strategy for treating SMA.

TI  - Metastatic heterogeneity of breast cancer cells is associated with expression of 
      a heterogeneous TGFbeta-activating miR424-503 gene cluster.
PG  - 6107-18
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0389 [doi]
AB  - TGFbeta signaling is known to drive metastasis in human cancer. Under physiologic
      conditions, the level of TGFbeta activity is tightly controlled by a regulatory
      network involving multiple negative regulators. At metastasis, however, these
      inhibitory mechanisms are usually overridden so that oncogenic TGFbeta signaling 
      can be overactivated and sustained. To better understand how the TGFbeta
      inhibitors are suppressed in metastatic breast cancer cells, we compared miRNA
      expression profiles between breast cancers with or without metastasis and found
      that the miR424-503 cluster was markedly overexpressed in metastatic breast
      cancer. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR424 and miR503 simultaneously
      suppressed Smad7 and Smurf2, two key inhibitory factors of TGFbeta signaling,
      leading to enhanced TGFbeta signaling and metastatic capability of breast cancer 
      cells. Moreover, antagonizing miR424-503 in breast cancer cells suppressed
      metastasis in vivo and increased overall host survival. Interestingly, our study 
      also found that heterogeneous expression of the miR424-503 cluster contributed to
      the heterogeneity of TGFbeta activity levels in, and metastatic potential of,
      breast cancer cell subsets. Overall, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism, 
      mediated by elevated expression of the miR424-503 cluster, underlying TGFbeta
      activation and metastasis of human breast cancer.

TI  - Examining the impact of migrant status on ethnic differences in mental health
      service use preceding a first diagnosis of schizophrenia.
PG  - 949-961
LID - 10.1007/s00127-017-1403-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Some ethnic groups have more negative contacts with health services for 
      first-episode psychosis, likely arising from a complex interaction between
      ethnicity, socio-economic factors, and immigration status. Using population-based
      health administrative data, we sought to examine the effects of ethnic group and 
      migrant status on patterns of health service use preceding a first diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder among people aged 14-35 over a 10-year 
      period. METHODS: We compared access to care and intensity of service use for
      first-generation ethnic minority groups to the general population of Ontario. To 
      control for migrant status, we restricted the sample to first-generation migrants
      and compared service use indicators for ethnic minority groups to the European
      migrant group. RESULTS: Our cohort included 18,080 people with a first diagnosis 
      of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, of whom 14.4% (n = 2607) were the
      first-generation migrants. Our findings suggest that the magnitude of ethnic
      differences in health service use is reduced and no longer statistically
      significant when the sample is restricted to first-generation migrants. Of
      exception, nearly, all migrant groups have lower intensity of primary care use,
      and Caribbean migrants are consistently less likely to use psychiatric services. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We observed fewer ethnic differences in health service use preceding
      the first diagnosis of psychosis when patterns are compared among
      first-generation migrants, rather than to the general population, suggesting that
      the choice of reference group influences ethnic patterning of health service use.
      We need a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind observed
      differences for minority groups to adequately address disparities in access to
      care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic Hypertension (SH) is a major cardiovascular risk factor with
      a high prevalence in almost all countries. Studies show the negative effect of SH
      on health-related quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life of 
      hypertensive patients when compared with the general population. METHODS: A total
      of 333 individuals of both genders and older than 18 years were evaluated; they
      were divided into the Study Group, consisting of 246 hypertensive patients
      undergoing treatment in a multidisciplinary service and the Control group,
      comprised of 87 normotensive individuals from the community. A sociodemographic
      questionnaire and the SF-36 for quality of life assessment were administered to
      both groups. The Chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann Whitney U-test,
      Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariate analysis were used for the statistical
      analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS and p values <0.05 were considered
      significant. RESULTS: The groups were homogeneous for age, gender, ethnicity,
      educational level and marital status. It was observed that normotensive
      individuals showed a better health-related quality of life when compared with
      hypertensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although considered to be almost always a
      clinically silent disease, systemic hypertension impairs the quality of life of
      patients who suffer from it.

PG  - e1005556
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005556 [doi]
AB  - We identified a functional single strand origin of replication (sso) in the
      integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1 of Bacillus subtilis. Integrative and 
      conjugative elements (ICEs, also known as conjugative transposons) are DNA
      elements typically found integrated into a bacterial chromosome where they are
      transmitted to daughter cells by chromosomal replication and cell division. Under
      certain conditions, ICEs become activated and excise from the host chromosome and
      can transfer to neighboring cells via the element-encoded conjugation machinery. 
      Activated ICEBs1 undergoes autonomous rolling circle replication that is needed
      for the maintenance of the excised element in growing and dividing cells. Rolling
      circle replication, used by many plasmids and phages, generates single-stranded
      DNA (ssDNA). In many cases, the presence of an sso enhances the conversion of the
      ssDNA to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by enabling priming of synthesis of the
      second DNA strand. We initially identified sso1 in ICEBs1 based on sequence
      similarity to the sso of an RCR plasmid. Several functional assays confirmed Sso 
      activity. Genetic analyses indicated that ICEBs1 uses sso1 and at least one other
      region for second strand DNA synthesis. We found that Sso activity was important 
      for two key aspects of the ICEBs1 lifecycle: 1) maintenance of the plasmid form
      of ICEBs1 in cells after excision from the chromosome, and 2) stable acquisition 
      of ICEBs1 following transfer to a new host. We identified sequences similar to
      known plasmid sso's in several other ICEs. Together, our results indicate that
      many other ICEs contain at least one single strand origin of replication, that
      these ICEs likely undergo autonomous replication, and that replication
      contributes to the stability and spread of these elements.

TI  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in India--is it different?
PG  - 142-6
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging clinical entity. There is
      limited data on NAFLD from India. The objective of this article was to review all
      the published literature on NAFLD from India. The epidemiological studies
      including prevalence ofNAFLD amongst special groups like in those with
      unexplained rise in transaminases, diabetes mellitus and cryptogenic cirrhosis,
      studies on pathogenesis including insulin resistance, iron abnormalities, and
      studies available for the treatment of such patients have been reviewed. In
      addition some of the differences between Indian patients and those from the West 
      have been highlighted. Available literature show that majority of Indian patients
      with NAFLD have overweight or obesity as per Asian Pacific criteria even though
      they do not have the kind of morbid obesity as seen in patients from the West.
      Other differences between Indian patients and those from the West include less of
      metabolic syndrome including its components like diabetes mellitus and
      hypertension, less of iron abnormalities and HFE gene mutations and mild
      histological disease at presentation in Indian patients. More data is required to
      substantiate these findings and to prove if NAFLD patients in India are different
      at presentation.

TI  - Association between the Increase in Body Mass Index and Medical Absenteeism in a 
      Peruvian Mining Population.
PG  - 129-136
LID - 10.15171/ijoem.2018.1201 [doi]
LID - 1201 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and overweight are associated with work absenteeism of
      medical cause. However, there is little knowledge on the relationship between
      incremental body mass index (BMI) and absenteeism. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
      effect of annual increase in BMI on amount of prolonged absenteeism. METHODS:
      Data from a longitudinal historical cohort of workers of a mining camp in Peru
      between 2006 and 2014 were used for the analysis. Prolonged absenteeism of 30
      days or more in one year was chosen as the dependent variable; annual increase in
      BMI was considered as the explanatory variable. Regression analysis with
      generalized estimating equation was used to determine the relative risk adjusted 
      for age, sex and type of work. RESULTS: There were 1347 cases of medical leave
      reported with a median of 6 days. Of all cases of medical leave, 11% of those who
      had an annual increase in BMI and 6% of those who maintained their BMI were cases
      of prolonged absenteeism. Prolonged absenteeism significantly increased in
      workers who had an annual increment in BMI (adj RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.29).
      CONCLUSION: The annual increase in BMI was marginally associated with prolonged
      absenteeism. Temporal increment in BMI, regardless of the baseline BMI, may be an
      independent determinant of the work absenteeism of medical cause.

TI  - QSAR Modeling of COX -2 Inhibitory Activity of Some Dihydropyridine and
      Hydroquinoline Derivatives Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Method.
PG  - 525-532
AB  - COX-2 inhibitory activities of some 1,4-dihydropyridine and
      5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives were modeled by quantitative
      structure-activity relationship (QSAR) using stepwise-multiple linear regression 
      (SW-MLR) method. The built model was robust and predictive with correlation
      coefficient (R(2)) of 0.972 and 0.531 for training and test groups, respectively.
      The quality of the model was evaluated by leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation
      (LOO correlation coefficient (Q(2)) of 0.943) and Y-randomization. We also
      employed a leverage approach for the defining of applicability domain of model.
      Based on QSAR models results, COX-2 inhibitory activity of selected data set had 
      correlation with BEHm6 (highest eigenvalue n. 6 of Burden matrix/weighted by
      atomic masses), Mor03u (signal 03/unweighted) and IVDE (Mean information content 
      on the vertex degree equality) descriptors which derived from their structures.

TI  - Changes in the prevalence of chronic disease and the association with disability 
      in the older Dutch population between 1987 and 2001.
PG  - 187-93
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afm185 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: most studies of older populations in developed countries show a
      decrease in the prevalence of disabilities, and an increase in chronic diseases
      over the past decades. Data in the Netherlands, however, mostly show an increase 
      in the prevalence of chronic diseases and mixed results with regard to the
      prevalence of disability. This study aims at comparing changes in the prevalence,
      as well as the association between chronic diseases and disability between 1987
      and 2001 in the older Dutch population using data representative of the general
      population. Most studies, so far, have only dealt with self-reported diseases,
      but in this study, we will use both self-reported and GP-registered diseases.
      STUDY DESIGN: data from the first (1987) and second (2001) Dutch National Survey 
      of General Practice were used. In 1987, 103 general practices, compared to 104 in
      2001, participated. Approximately 5% of the listed persons aged 18 years and over
      was asked to participate in an extensive health interview survey. An all-age
      random sample was drawn by the researchers from the patients listed in the
      participating practices (in 1987 n = 2, 708; in 2001 n = 3, 474). Both surveys
      are community based, with an age range between 55 and 97 years. Data on chronic
      diseases were based on GP registries and self-report. RESULTS: the prevalence of 
      disability and of asthma/COPD, cardiac disease, stroke, and osteoarthritis
      decreased between 1987 and 2001, while the prevalence of diabetes increased.
      Changes were largely similar for GP-registered and self-reported diseases.
      Cardiac disease, asthma/COPD, and depression led to less disability, whereas low 
      back pain and osteoarthritis led to more disability. CONCLUSIONS: in general,
      there were reductions in GP-registered chronic diseases as well as in
      self-reported diseases and disability. Results suggest that the disabling impact 
      of fatal diseases decreased, while the impact of non-fatal diseases increased.

TI  - Experiences and career intentions of combat-deployed UK military personnel.
PG  - 177-183
LID - 10.1093/occmed/kqy024 [doi]
AB  - Background: Most studies of the psychological impact of military deployment focus
      on the negative and traumatic aspects. Less is known about the full range of
      deployment experiences nor how these may impact on career intentions. Aims: To
      examine subjective operational experiences and career intentions in deployed UK
      military personnel using data gathered toward the end of an operational
      deployment. Methods: Data were gathered during deployment in Iraq and
      Afghanistan. A self-report survey collected data on sociodemographic, operational
      and military factors. Respondents provided their strength of agreement or
      disagreement with six potentially positive deployment experiences and their
      endorsement or rejection of six possible career intentions. Two mental health
      measures assessed symptoms of common mental disorder and post-traumatic stress
      disorder. Results: Responses were 681 in Iran 2009 (100% response rate); 1421 in 
      Afghanistan in 2010 (100%), 1362 in 2011 (96%) and 860 in 2015 (91%). Five of the
      potentially positive outcomes were endorsed by >50% of the sample: confidence
      about remaining healthy after returning home, pride in accomplishments, increased
      confidence in abilities, improved unit cohesion and experiencing a positive life 
      effect. Ninety per cent of respondents planned to continue in service after
      returning home. Fewer positive deployment experiences, poorer mental health,
      lesser unit cohesion and more negative impressions of leadership were
      significantly associated with intention to leave service. Conclusions: Contrary
      to the popular belief that UK military personnel deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan 
      experience negative outcomes, this paper shows that deployment can be a positive 
      experience for a substantial majority of deployed personnel.

AB  - Enteroglial cells (EGCs) play critical roles in human health and disease,
      however, EGC-dependent neuropathies also affect commercially important animal
      species. Due to the lack of data on the distribution and phenotypic
      characterization of the EGCs throughout the bovine gastrointestinal tract, in
      this study the topographic localization of EGCs in the jejunum of healthy cattle 
      was investigated by immunofluorescence using the glial specific marker glial
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the panneuronal marker PGP 9.5. This
      analysis was conducted on both cryosections and whole mount preparations
      including the myenteric and the submucous plexuses of the bovine jejunum. The
      results obtained showed the presence of a large subpopulation of GFAP-expressing 
      EGCs in the main plexuses and within the muscle layers, whereas only few
      GFAP-positive glial processes were found within the deeper layer of the mucosa,
      and they never reached the mucosal epithelium. Three different EGC subtypes,
      namely I, III and IV types were recognized in the examined tract of the bovine
      intestine. Overall, our results provide the basis for future investigations aimed
      at elucidating the functional role of the GFAP-containing EGCs which is crucial
      for a better understanding of the physio-pathology of the bovine intestine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No general consensus has yet been established for the gold standard
      treatment of ankle syndesmotic complex injuries. Recent literature has documented
      the success of ankle tightrope fixation for heterogeneous ankle fracture
      patterns, resulting in syndesmotic complex injuries. We present a multicentre
      case series assessing the clinical, radiological and functional outcomes of
      patients with Weber C ankle fractures treated with the Arthrex TightRope((R))
      fixation system. METHOD: We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult
      patients with Weber C ankle fractures who were treated with the Arthrex
      TightRope((R)) fixation system at four centres over a 3-year period. All patients
      were followed up for a mean of 14 months (range 12-26). Outcomes measures were
      assessed subjectively using functional scores (AOFAS and Olerud and Molander) and
      objectively using radiological measurements, complication rates and revision
      surgery rates. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients met our eligibility criteria. The
      mean age at operation was 31 years (range 18-65). There were 20 males and 16
      females. No patients were lost to follow-up. The ankle tightrope maintained
      satisfactory reduction in the ankle mortise in 97% of cases. Of these 35
      successfully treated cases, no evidence of re-displacement on follow-up
      radiographs of the syndesmotic complex was observed at an average of 10.8 months 
      (range 6-12). Post-operative mean medial clear space was 3.1 mm, and mean
      tibio-fibular overlap was 10.1 mm. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle
      Society (AOFAS) score was 88.8 (range 67-98) at a mean follow-up of 14 months
      (range 12-26). The overall complication rate was 6% (one failure requiring
      revision surgery and one medial sided skin irritation requiring removal of suture
      button). No infections or wound complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Tightrope
      fixation is a safe alternative to screw fixation for syndesmotic complex injuries
      in Weber C ankle fractures. We have shown that it has low complication rates and 
      a high patient satisfaction.

TI  - Co-occurrence of citrinin and ochratoxin A in rice in Asia and its implications
      for human health.
PG  - 2055-2059

AB  - Citrinin (CIT) and ochratoxin A (OTA) are nephrotoxic mycotoxins, produced by
      several Aspergillus and Penicillium species and their co-occurrence in rice may
      cause health effects in humans. Rice is an important food crop worldwide and is a
      major staple food in Asia which may be invaded by CIT and OTA producing fungal
      spores in the field, during harvest and storage. Humans are exposed to these
      mycotoxins through ingestion of contaminated rice and other food commodities.
      Yet, data on the combined presence to these food contaminants are still
      insufficient to estimate human exposure in Asia. This review describes the
      prevalence of CIT and OTA in rice in Asia and its implications on human health,
      which may help in establishing and carrying out proper management strategies
      against mould development on rice. From the health point of view, combined
      exposition of CIT and OTA should be a public concern as both are nephrotoxic and 
      long-term exposure can pose detrimental health effects. Thus, it is necessary for
      local farmers and food factories to implement strict measures and to improve
      methods for rice preservation during the distribution to consumers, particularly 
      in the markets. Moreover, regular surveys for CIT and OTA occurrence in rice and 
      human biomonitoring are recommended to reduce the health effects in Asian
      population. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Implicit/explicit memory dissociation in Alzheimer's disease: the consequence of 
      inappropriate processing?
PG  - 710-7
LID - 10.1037/a0012986 [doi]
AB  - Dual-process theories of recognition posit that perceptual fluency contributes to
      both familiarity-based explicit recognition and perceptual priming. However, the 
      priming-without-recognition dissociation, as observed through the intact mere
      exposure effect and impaired recognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), might indicate that familiarity and perceptual priming are functionally
      distinct. This study investigated whether the AD patients' processing strategies 
      at testing may explain this priming-without-recognition dissociation. First, we
      replicated the priming-without-recognition effect in 16 patients who exhibited
      intact exposure effects despite null recognition. Second, we showed that, under
      identical conditions, inducing a holistic processing strategy during recognition 
      testing increased AD patients' recognition--performance was similar for AD
      patients and healthy control participants. Furthermore, prompting analytic
      processing during both priming and recognition tasks decreased AD patients'
      performance in both tasks. These findings suggest that the extent to which AD
      patients use perceptual fluency in priming and recognition tasks is contingent on
      their processing approach. The choice of processing strategy may depend on how
      difficult patients perceive the task to be.

AB  - Interferon-gamma-inducible-lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) plays a key role in
      the processing and presentation of MHC class II-restricted antigen (Ag) by
      catalyzing disulfide bond reduction, thus unfolding native protein Ag and
      facilitating subsequent cleavage by proteases. In this study, we reported the
      cloning of a GILT gene homologue from chicken (designated cGILT). The open
      reading frame (ORF) of cGILT consists of 762 bases, encoding a protein of 253
      amino acids, with a putative molecular weight of 28kDa. The deduced protein
      possesses the typical structural feature of known GILT proteins, including an
      active-site motif, a GILT signature sequence, and 6 conserved cysteines. Genomic 
      analysis revealed that cGILT gene, spanning a 1868bp fragment, contained seven
      exons interrupted by six introns. The result of real-time PCR showed that cGILT
      mRNA was expressed in a tissue-specific manner, while the cGILT mRNA expression
      was obviously up-regulated in spleen and PBMCs after stimulation with
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After expression as a soluble protein in Escherichia
      coli and purification by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, cGILT was demonstrated
      to exhibit thiol reductase activity on IgG substrate.

AB  - alpha1-Acid glycoprotein (AGP) is an acute phase protein that modulates innate
      immunity and increases in response to infection or injury. The effects of native 
      (phosphorylated) and partially dephosphorylated AGP on the antimicrobial
      activities of bovine polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) and monocytes were
      evaluated. Native AGP inhibited phagocytosis and killing of Escherichia coli by
      PMNs and monocytes. Engulfment and killing of E. coli were reduced at the acute
      phase concentration of AGP (0.9 mg/mL) compared with a physiological
      concentration (0.3mg/mL). The ability of AGP to inhibit phagocytosis by monocytes
      and the killing of E. coli by PMNs was reduced following dephosphorylation. The
      findings indicate that the functions of PMNs and monocytes are differentially
      regulated by varying concentrations of AGP and its phosphorylation state.

AB  - Dynamic gene expression during cellular differentiation is tightly coordinated by
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. An emerging theme is the
      central role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of this
      specificity. Recent advances demonstrate that lncRNAs are expressed in a
      lineage-specific manner and control the development of several cell types in the 
      hematopoietic system. Moreover, specific lncRNAs are induced to modulate innate
      and adaptive immune responses. lncRNAs can function via RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, and
      RNA-protein target interactions. As a result, they affect several stages of gene 
      regulation, including chromatin modification, mRNA biogenesis, and protein
      signaling. We discuss recent advances, future prospects, and challenges in
      understanding the roles of lncRNAs in immunity and immune-mediated diseases.

      instructed to take a supplement (Pycnogenol(R) 60 mg/day, L-arginine 690 mg/day
      and aspartic acid 552 mg/day) or an identical placebo for 8 weeks, and the
      results were assessed using the five-item erectile domain (IIEF-5) of the
      International Index of Erectile Function. Additionally, blood biochemistry,
      urinalysis and salivary testosterone were measured. Eight weeks of supplement
      intake improved the total score of the IIEF-5. In particular, a marked
      improvement was observed in 'hardness of erection' and 'satisfaction with sexual 
      intercourse'. A decrease in blood pressure, aspartate transaminase and
      gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP), and a slight increase in salivary
      testosterone were observed in the supplement group. No adverse reactions were
      observed during the study period. In conclusion, Pycnogenol(R) in combination
      with L-arginine as a dietary supplement is effective and safe in Japanese
      patients with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction.

AB  - Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone implicated in many diseases including cancer and
      neurodegenerative disease. Most inhibitors target the ATPase site in Hsp90's
      N-terminal domain, with relatively few inhibitors of other domains reported to
      date. Here, we show that peptides derived from a short helix at the C-terminus of
      Hsp90 show micromolar activity as Hsp90 inhibitors in vitro. These inhibitors do 
      not block the N-terminal domain's ATP-binding site, and thus are likely to bind
      at the C-terminal domain. Substitutions and helix stapling were applied to
      demonstrate structure-activity relationships and improve activity. These helical 
      peptides will help guide the design of a new class of inhibitors of Hsp90's
      C-terminal domain.

TI  - Biophysical methods for the study of microbial surfaces.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2011.00207 [doi]
AB  - The challenge in studying the surface architecture of different microbial
      pathogens is to integrate the most current biochemical, spectroscopic,
      microscopic, and processing techniques. Individually these methods have
      insufficient sensitivity to reveal complex structures, such as branched, large,
      viscous polymers with a high structure hydration, size, and complexity. However, 
      when used in combination biophysical techniques are our primary source of
      information for understanding polydisperse molecules and complex microbial
      surfaces. Biophysical methods seek to explain biological function in terms of the
      molecular structures and properties of specific molecules. The sizes of the
      molecules found in microbial surfaces vary greatly from small fatty acids and
      sugars to macromolecules like proteins, polysaccharides, and pigments, such as
      melanin. These molecules, which comprise the building blocks of living organisms,
      assemble into cells, tissues, and whole organisms by forming complex individual
      structures with dimensions from 10 to 10,000 nm and larger. Biophysics is
      directed to determining the structure of specific biological molecules and of the
      larger structures into which they assemble. Some of this effort involves
      developing new methods, adapting old methods and building new instruments for
      viewing these structures. The description of biophysical properties in an
      experimental model where, properties such as flexibility, hydrodynamic
      characteristics, and size can be precisely determined is of great relevance to
      study the affinity of the surfaces with biologically active and inert substrates 
      and the interaction with host molecules. Furthermore, this knowledge could
      establish the abilities of different molecules and their structures to
      differentially activate cellular responses. Recent studies in the fungal pathogen
      Cryptococcus neoformans have demonstrated that the physical properties of its
      unique polysaccharide capsule correlate with the biological functions associated 
      with the intact capsule and the components comprising the capsule. In this
      review, we describe the application of biophysical techniques to study and
      characterize this highly hydrated and fragile fungal surface structure.

TI  - Safety and clinical outcomes of patients treated with abiraterone acetate after
      docetaxel: results of the Italian Named Patient Programme.
PG  - 764-71
LID - 10.1111/bju.12857 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate (AA) in
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated in 
      a compassionate named patient programme (NPP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
      retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients with mCRPC treated with
      AA at the standard daily oral dose of 1000 mg plus prednisone 10 mg/day in 19
      Italian hospitals. RESULTS: We assessed 265 patients with mCRPC treated with AA. 
      The most frequent (>1%) grade 3-4 toxicities were anaemia (4.2%), fatigue (4.2%),
      and bone pain (1.5%). The median progression-free survival was 7 months; median
      overall survival was 17 months after starting AA, and 35 months after the first
      docetaxel administration. Our study reproduced the clinical outcomes reported in 
      the AA pivotal trial, including those relating to special populations such as the
      elderly, patients with a poor performance status, symptomatic patients, and
      patients with visceral metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the safety and
      activity of AA when administered outside clinical trials, and confirm the
      findings of the post-docetaxel pivotal trial in the patients as a whole
      population and in special populations of specific interest.

      early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 199-205
LID - 10.3233/CBM-160512 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to explore the prognostic value of in
      situ memory T cells and patterns of invasion (POI) in early stage oral squamous
      cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with early stage
      (cT1T2N0) OSCC were identified from a pre-existing database of patients with oral
      cancer and were classified by POI according to hematoxylin-eosin staining. We
      examined the impact of the immunohistochemical expression of CD45RO in OSCC.
      Overall survival (OS) curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
      RESULTS: Margin status was significantly associated with local recurrence in
      early stage OSCC (p= 0.000), and depth of invasion was also associated with
      regional recurrence (2 mm: p= 0.034; 4 mm: p= 0.015). The expression of CD45RO
      (p= 0.021) and POI (p= 0.027) individually was associated with OS, and patients
      in the group with combination score tended to have worse OS (p= 0.012).
      CONCLUSION: Combined evaluation of POI and CD45RO might prove to be a useful
      indicator for high-risk patients with occult metastases from early stage OSCC.

TI  - Randomized Polypill crossover trial in people aged 50 and over.
PG  - e41297
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0041297 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A Polypill is proposed for the primary prevention of cardiovascular
      disease in people judged to be at risk on account of their age alone. Its
      efficacy in reducing cholesterol and blood pressure is uncertain. METHODS: We
      conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of a
      Polypill among individuals aged 50+ without a history of cardiovascular disease
      and compared the reductions with those predicted from published estimates of the 
      effects of the individual drugs. Participants took the Polypill (amlodipine 2.5
      mg, losartan 25 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and simvastatin 40 mg) each
      evening for 12 weeks and a placebo each evening for 12 weeks in random sequence. 
      The mean within-person differences in blood pressure and low density lipoprotein 
      (LDL) cholesterol at the end of each 12 week period were determined. RESULTS: 84 
      out of 86 participants completed both treatment periods. The mean systolic blood 
      pressure was reduced by 17.9 mmHg (95% CI, 15.7-20.1) on the Polypill, diastolic 
      blood pressure by 9.8 mmHg (8.1-11.5), and LDL cholesterol by 1.4 mmol/L
      (1.2-1.6), reductions of 12%, 11%, and 39% respectively. The results were almost 
      identical to those predicted; 18.4 mmHg, 9.7 mmHg, and 1.4 mmol/L respectively.
      CONCLUSION: The Polypill resulted in the predicted reductions in blood pressure
      and LDL cholesterol. Long term reductions of this magnitude would have a
      substantial effect in preventing heart attacks and strokes. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Adaptive evolution of the human fatty acid synthase gene: support for the cancer 
      selection and fat utilization hypotheses?
PG  - 151-9
AB  - Cancer may act as the etiological agent for natural selection in some genes. This
      selective pressure would act to reduce the success of neoplastic lineages over
      normal cell lineages in individuals of reproductive age. In addition, human's
      relatively larger brain and longer lifespan may have also acted as a selective
      force requiring new genotypes. One of the most important proteins in both
      processes is the fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene involved in fatty acid
      biosynthesis. A variety of other proteins, including PTEN, MAPK1, SREBP1, SREBP2 
      and PI are also involved in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. We have
      specifically analysed variability in selective pressure across all these genes in
      human, mouse and other vertebrates. We have found that the FAS gene alone has
      signatures indicative of adaptive evolution. We did not find any signatures of
      adaptive evolution in any of the other proteins. In the FAS gene, we have
      detected an excess of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions in
      approximately 6% of sites in the human lineage. Contrastingly, the substitution
      process at these sites in other available vertebrates and mammals indicates
      strong purifying selection. This is likely to reflect a functional shift in human
      FAS and correlates well with previously observed changes in FAS biochemical
      activities. We speculate that the role played by FAS either in cancer development
      or in human brain development has created this selective pressure, although we
      cannot rule out the various other functions of FAS.

TI  - Multiscroll attractors by switching systems.
PG  - 013116
LID - 10.1063/1.3314278 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we present a class of three-dimensional dynamical systems having
      multiscrolls which we call unstable dissipative systems (UDSs). The UDSs are
      dissipative in one of its components but unstable in the other two. This class of
      systems is constructed with a switching law to display various multiscroll
      strange attractors. The multiscroll strange attractors result from the
      combination of several unstable "one-spiral" trajectories by means of switching. 
      Each of these trajectories lies around a saddle hyperbolic stationary point.
      Thus, we describe how a piecewise-linear switching system yields multiscroll
      attractors, symmetric or asymmetric, with chaotic behavior.

TI  - [Anxiety as an independent cardiovascular risk].
PG  - 5-11
AB  - Anxiety itself, and anxiety disorders in particular, seem to represent an
      independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases as important as obesity,
      hypertension, sendentary lifestyle or hyperlipidemia. Anxiety-related
      noradrenaline and HPA overactivity, excessive sympathetic nervous system
      activation, and the permanently elevated level of several neuropeptides and
      cytokines result in hypertension and arrhythmias, endothel lesions, detrimental
      hemodynamic changes and platelet overactivation facilitating thrombosis. Patients
      with severe and sustained anxiety usually have additional adverse health
      behaviors which further aggravate the hazards. Epidemiological studies agree in
      finding markedly increased incidence of myocardial infarct, coronary heart
      disease or other cardiovascular conditions, often with earlier age of onset,
      faster progression and higher letality, in anxiety disorder patients. Better
      recognition and adequate treatment of anxiety disorders may therefore contribute 
      to curbing the excessive--and typically early-onset--cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality in Hungary.

TI  - A Deep Feature Learning Method for Drill Bits Monitoring Using the Spectral
      Analysis of the Acoustic Signals.
LID - E2634 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s18082634 [doi]
AB  - Machine fault diagnosis (MFD) has gained an important enthusiasm since the
      unfolding of the pattern recognition techniques in the last three decades. It
      refers to all of the studies that aim to automatically detect the faults on the
      machines using various kinds of signals that they can generate. The present work 
      proposes a MFD system for the drilling machines that is based on the sounds they 
      produce. The first key contribution of this paper is to present a system
      specifically designed for the drills, by attempting not only to detect the faulty
      drills but also to detect whether the sounds were generated during the active or 
      the idling stage of the whole machinery system, in order to provide a complete
      remote control. The second key contribution of the work is to represent the power
      spectrum of the sounds as images and apply some transformations on them in order 
      to reveal, expose, and emphasize the health patterns that are hidden inside them.
      The created images, the so-called power spectrum density (PSD)-images, are then
      given to a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) for a high-level feature
      extraction process. The final step of the scheme consists of adopting the
      proposed PSD-images + DCAE features as the final representation of the original
      sounds and utilize them as the inputs of a nonlinear classifier whose outputs
      will represent the final diagnosis decision. The results of the experiments
      demonstrate the high discrimination potential afforded by the proposed PSD-images
      + DCAE features. They were also tested on a noisy dataset and the results show
      their robustness against noises.

PG  - e0131809
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0131809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Educational disparities in U.S. adult mortality are large and have
      widened across birth cohorts. We consider three policy relevant scenarios and
      estimate the mortality attributable to: (1) individuals having less than a high
      school degree rather than a high school degree, (2) individuals having some
      college rather than a baccalaureate degree, and (3) individuals having anything
      less than a baccalaureate degree rather than a baccalaureate degree, using
      educational disparities specific to the 1925, 1935, and 1945 cohorts. METHODS: We
      use the National Health Interview Survey data (1986-2004) linked to prospective
      mortality through 2006 (N=1,008,949), and discrete-time survival models, to
      estimate education- and cohort-specific mortality rates. We use those mortality
      rates and data on the 2010 U.S. population from the American Community Survey, to
      calculate annual attributable mortality estimates. RESULTS: If adults aged 25-85 
      in the 2010 U.S. population experienced the educational disparities in mortality 
      observed in the 1945 cohort, 145,243 deaths could be attributed to individuals
      having less than a high school degree rather than a high school degree, 110,068
      deaths could be attributed to individuals having some college rather than a
      baccalaureate degree, and 554,525 deaths could be attributed to individuals
      having anything less than a baccalaureate degree rather than a baccalaureate
      degree. Widening educational disparities between the 1925 and 1945 cohorts result
      in a doubling of attributable mortality. Mortality attributable to having less
      than a high school degree is proportionally similar among women and men and among
      non-Hispanic blacks and whites, and is greater for cardiovascular disease than
      for cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality attributable to low education is comparable in
      magnitude to mortality attributable to individuals being current rather than
      former smokers. Existing research suggests that a substantial part of the
      association between education and mortality is causal. Thus, policies that
      increase education could significantly reduce adult mortality.

      treatment with DAA with or without pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) in real life.
      This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort trial, executed in 15 hospitals
      distributed across Belgium. Populations were matched based on fibrosis score
      (Metavir F3-F4). Patients with a Child-Pugh score >/= B were excluded. In total, 
      567 patients were included, of whom 77 were treated with PEG-IFN+DAA between 2008
      and 2013 and 490 with DAA without PEG-IFN between 2013 and 2015. Patients treated
      with PEG-IFN+DAA (53+/-9y) were younger than patients treated with DAA without
      PEG-IFN (59+/-12y) (P=.001). 47% of patients treated with PEG-IFN+DAA were in the
      F4 stage vs 67% of patients treated with DAA without PEG-IFN (P=.001). Screening 
      was inadequate in 20% of both patient groups (P=.664). The early occurrence rate 
      of HCC was 1.7% and 1.1% in patients treated with DAA with and without PEG-IFN,
      respectively (P=.540). The early recurrence rate was 0% in patients treated with 
      PEG-IFN+DAA and 15.0% in patients treated with DAA without PEG-IFN (P=.857).
      There is no difference in early occurrence of new HCC between patients treated
      with DAA with and without PEG-IFN. We did observe a high early recurrence rate of
      HCC in patients treated with DAA without PEG-IFN. However, these patients were at
      baseline more at risk for HCC. Finally, in 20%, screening for HCC was inadequate.

      Contraception in Six Indian States.

AB  - Women receiving induced abortions or postabortion care are at high risk of
      subsequent unintended pregnancy, and intervals of less than six months between
      abortion and subsequent pregnancy may be associated with adverse outcomes. This
      study highlights the prevalence and attributes of postabortion contraceptive
      acceptance from 2,456 health facilities in six major Indian states, among 292,508
      women who received abortion care services from July 2011 through June 2014.
      Eighty-one percent of the women accepted postabortion contraceptive methods: 53
      percent short-term, 11 percent intrauterine devices, and 16 percent
      sterilization. Postabortion contraceptive acceptance was highest among women who 
      were aged 25 years and older, received first-trimester services, received induced
      abortion, attended primary-level health facilities, and had medical abortions.
      Doctors receiving post-training support were more likely to offer contraceptives,
      but no association was observed between such support and acceptance of IUDs or
      sterilization. Comprehensive service-delivery interventions, including ensuring
      availability of skilled providers and contraceptive commodities, offering
      clinical mentoring for providers, identifying and addressing provider bias, and
      improving provider counseling skills, can increase postabortion contraceptive
      acceptance and reduce unintended pregnancy.

TI  - Increased cervical cancer risk associated with screening at longer intervals.
PG  - 311-5
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000632 [doi]
AB  - The 2012 national recommendations for cervical cancer screening will produce a
      lower level of cervical cancer protection than previously afforded by annual
      cytology or 3-year cotesting. After a single negative cotest result, the risk of 
      cervical cancer is twice as large at 5 years as it is at 3 years. Modeling
      published since the 2012 guidelines were drafted indicates that extending the
      cotesting screening interval from 3 to 5 years at ages 30-64 years will result in
      an additional 1 woman in 369 compliant with screening receiving a cervical cancer
      diagnosis during her lifetime, and an additional 1 in 1,639 dying of cervical
      cancer. The authors believe that a significant number of patients and providers
      would not choose to accept these additional risks if they understood them,
      despite the recognition of potential harms associated with more intensive
      screening.

TI  - Observational cohort study of the natural history of Niemann-Pick disease type C 
      in the UK: a 5-year update from the UK clinical database.
PG  - 257
LID - 10.1186/s12883-015-0511-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare neurovisceral lipid
      storage disorder characterised by progressive, disabling neurological symptoms
      and premature death in most patients. During the last decade, national cohort
      studies have accrued a great deal of data on the symptomatology and natural
      history of NP-C. METHODS: In an observational cohort study, we present a
      substantial update based on the clinical presentation and follow-up of all known 
      UK-based patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NP-C who have been tracked on an 
      electronic database at the Department of Genetic Medicine, University of
      Manchester, UK. Patients were stratified according to accepted
      age-at-neurological-onset categories. Data on patients' clinical signs and
      symptoms, medical history and genetic studies are summarised using descriptive
      methods. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients with NP-C were included, representing
      the full known UK NP-C cohort, as observed from database information between 1999
      and the end of 2011: 72 patients (49 %) were alive at the end of the observation 
      period. Among a total of 116 patients (79 %) who possessed at least one
      identified, disease-causing NP-C gene mutation, 114 (98 %) had NPC1 and two (2 %)
      had NPC2 mutations. Overall, 53/194 (27 %) identified mutations were novel. Six
      patients (4 %) had an early, non-neurological neonatal onset form of NP-C. The
      numbers (%) of patients with accepted age-at-neurological onset forms were: 8 (5 
      %) early-infantile onset, 51 (35 %) late-infantile onset, 42 (29 %) juvenile
      onset, and 25 (17 %) adolescent/adult onset. Fourteen patients diagnosed based on
      visceral symptoms and/or sibling history, confirmed in most cases by genetic
      analysis, did not have any neurological manifestations at last follow up (11
      patients with mean [SD] age at last follow up 2.5 [1.8] years: 3 with mean [SD]
      age at death 20.8 [15.9] years). A total of 51 patients (35 %) received miglustat
      therapy. The mean (SD) overall treatment duration up to the end of the
      observation period was 2.6 (2.3) years. CONCLUSIONS: This UK cohort is the
      largest national NP-C cohort reported to date, and confirms the wide phenotypic
      variability of the disease, as reported in other countries. Further analyses are 
      required to assess the impact of miglustat therapy on neurological disease
      progression.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with substance use disorder (SUD) are frequently suffering
      from co-occurring somatic disorders, increasing the risk of mortality. Somatic
      health care utilization (sHCU) often remains unknown to the physician during SUD 
      treatment. This paper analyses sHCU and associated costs among patients in SUD
      treatment compared to matched, non-substance dependent controls. METHODS: Health 
      care utilization data on 4972 SUD patients were matched to 19,846 controls by
      gender, birth year and ethnic origin. Subcategories of patients were formed based
      on SUD and on co-morbid psychiatric disorder. Data on sHCU during the year prior 
      to the last treatment contact (the 'index date') for both patients and their
      matched controls were extracted from a health insurance database. RESULTS:
      Patients had a higher sHCU (with increased associated costs) than controls,
      especially when alcohol dependence was involved. In particular, sHCU for
      cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious diseases, injuries and accidents was
      increased among patients. However, the use of preventive medication, such as
      lipid-lowering drugs, is lower among SUD patients. Co-morbidity of psychiatric
      disorders led to further increase of sHCU, whereas patients with comorbid
      non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD) showed lower sHCU and costs. CONCLUSION: 
      Patients with SUD overall have a high sHCU, associated with high costs. There are
      indications that SUD patients have less access to preventive medication. Patients
      with comorbid NAPD are at risk of possible underutilization of somatic health
      care. Furthermore, we conclude that these larger administrative databases allow
      for comparisons between various diagnostic categories.

AB  - Metaphors are individualized representations of self as well as a vivid,
      expressive, everyday dialogical format. Holistic nursing is a personal philosophy
      that includes participating in the healing-caring process of self and others.
      Exploring metaphors of nurses offers a unique opportunity of understanding how
      they describe, prioritize, and internalize their practice. The aim of this
      article is to present metaphors of holistic nurses.

TI  - Patulin and its dietary intake by fruit juice consumption in Iran.
PG  - 40-3
LID - 10.1080/19393210.2014.967814 [doi]
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine levels and dietary intake of patulin (PAT)
      from fruit juices consumed in Iran. PAT content was determined using high
      performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection in 161 samples of fruit
      juices including apple, pineapple, pear, peach, pomegranate and white and red
      grape juices. Results revealed the presence of PAT in 16.1% of the samples
      examined, ranging from 5 to 190.7 microg/kg. Average and median PAT content in
      positive samples was 34.5 and 18.5 microg/kg, respectively. PAT concentration in 
      2.5% of the samples was higher than the maximum limit as set by European
      regulations for PAT in fruit products (50 microg/kg). Estimated daily intake of
      PAT by fruit juice was 16.4, 45.9 and 74.6 ng/kg bw/day for Iranian adults,
      children and babies, respectively. The results of this study showed that PAT does
      not seem to be a problem in fruit-based drinks commercialised in Iran, except for
      apple juice.

TI  - Prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms--a screening program in Sao Paulo,
      Brazil.
PG  - 158-60
AB  - CONTEXT: Abdominal aortic aneurysm is an asymptomatic but potentially fatal
      condition. Elective surgery can prevent death from rupture, and is indicated for 
      aneurysms larger than 45 mm. Because aneurysms tend to grow with time, detection 
      of small ones (> 29 mm) may lead to a closer follow-up of patients at risk.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in Sao
      Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive. SETTING: University Hospital.
      PARTICIPANTS: Persons aged 50 years or more were offered, through the press, the 
      opportunity to be screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The total number
      screened was 2,756. PROCEDURE: All were submitted to abdominal palpation and
      ultrasound examination. PARAMETER STUDIED: A maximum diameter of 30 mm or more
      was considered to be an aneurysm. RESULTS: Sixty-four aneurysms were detected,
      nine of which measuring more than 49 mm. Palpation detected 60 aneurysms, but
      only 20 of these were confirmed by the ultrasound. Conversely, 41 of the
      ultrasound-detected aneurysms were not palpable. The percentages of abdominal
      aortic aneurysms found in the subgroups via ultrasound examination (with 95%
      confidence interval) were as follows: total group, 2.3 (1.8-3); men, 4.6
      (3.5-5.9); women, 0.6 (0.3-1.1); men aged 60 or more, 6 (4.3-8); women aged 60 or
      more, 0.9 (0.4-1.8). CONCLUSION: In Sao Paulo, Brazil, 1.8 to 3 % of persons aged
      50 years or more are expected to have abdominal aortic aneurysms. In the subgroup
      of men aged 60 or more, the expected prevalence is between 4.3 and 8%.

TI  - Evaluation of the tip-bending response in clinically used endoscopes.
PG  - E466-71
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-104115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic interventions require accurate and precise 
      control of the endoscope tip. The endoscope tip response depends on a cable
      pulling system, which is known to deliver a significantly nonlinear response that
      eventually reduces control. It is unknown whether the current technique of
      endoscope tip control is adequate for a future of high precision procedures,
      steerable accessories, and add-on robotics. The aim of this study was to
      determine the status of the tip response of endoscopes used in clinical practice.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 20 flexible colonoscopes and five
      gastroscopes, used in the endoscopy departments of a Dutch university hospital
      and two Dutch teaching hospitals, in a bench top setup. First, maximal tip
      bending was determined manually. Next, the endoscope navigation wheels were
      rotated individually in a motor setup. Tip angulation was recorded with a USB
      camera. Cable slackness was derived from the resulting hysteresis plot. RESULTS: 
      Only two of the 20 colonoscopes (10 %) and none of the five gastroscopes reached 
      the maximal tip angulation specified by the manufacturer. Four colonoscopes (20
      %) and none of the gastroscopes demonstrated the recommended cable tension. Eight
      colonoscopes (40 %) had undergone a maintenance check 1 month before the
      measurements were made. The tip responses of these eight colonoscopies did not
      differ significantly from the tip responses of the other colonoscopes.
      CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the majority of clinically used endoscopes
      are not optimally tuned to reach maximal bending angles and demonstrate adequate 
      tip responses. We suggest a brief check before procedures to predict difficulties
      with bending angles and tip responses.

TI  - Toxicity evaluation of herbal pharmaceutical wastewater to the freshwater
      crustacean Cypris spp.
PG  - 1441-5
LID - 10.2166/wst.2011.327 [doi]
AB  - In India a large number of pharmaceutical industries are manufacturing drugs of
      complex type subsequently producing huge quantities of wastewaters. The herbal
      pharmaceutical industries are one of them which manufacture various herbal
      medicines from natural products and certain chemicals and metal combinations.
      During their manufacturing process a large number of toxicants enter the
      watercourse harming the biota of the receiving water bodies. Zooplankton
      organisms being at the base of the food chain if affected, will subsequently
      affect the fisheries potential at large, harming the interest of man. Keeping
      this point in view a herbal pharmaceutical manufacturing industry based at Nagpur
      was selected for investigation with respect to assessing its toxic effect on the 
      freshwater crustacean Cypris spp. during short duration toxicity tests. This
      research paper discusses in detail the bioassay evaluation of raw, neutralized
      and physico-chemically treated herbal pharmaceutical effluent for arriving at a
      concentration safe for the Cypris spp.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to present the results for patients with
      atherosclerotic aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) treated with a
      novel thoracic stent graft. METHODS: A single-center retrospective review of
      prospectively collected data was performed. We extracted demographic variables as
      well as atherosclerotic comorbidities and operation-related and imaging-related
      data from patients' medical records. We estimated technical success rate,
      in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and mortality at the end of follow-up as well
      as complication and reintervention rate in our study cohort. Follow-up computed
      tomography angiography was performed after 1 month and 6 months and yearly
      thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (80% male; mean age, 73.7 +/- 6.33
      years) were treated with Ankura Thoracic Stent Graft (Lifetech, Shenzhen, China) 
      for DTA aneurysm from February 2014 until June 2017. Technical success of the
      thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was 97% (29/30 patients). A surgical 
      conduit was required in one patient; in three patients, we intentionally covered 
      the left subclavian artery because of insufficient proximal landing zone. No
      aorta-related deaths were recorded during follow-up. During the early
      postoperative period, two patients (7%) with long DTA coverage developed
      paralysis or paraparesis, which immediately resolved after lumbar drainage. No
      renal complications requiring dialysis were observed. One patient (3%) developed 
      postoperative pulmonary infection, whereas access site complications were 7%. Two
      symptomatic patients treated outside instructions for use (7%) developed early
      type IA endoleak and one patient (3%) developed type IB endoleak; type II
      endoleak was recorded in 3% of the study cohort. During the 30-day postoperative 
      period, two patients died of non-TEVAR-related causes, one of gastrointestinal
      bleeding and the other of pulmonary infection. During a median follow-up of 31.7 
      (range, 38.4) months, two more patients also died of non-TEVAR-related causes,
      one of stroke from carotid artery disease and the other of motor vehicle trauma. 
      In the rest of the cohort, no other adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      novel endograft showed early evidence of a safe, effective, and durable
      endoprosthesis for the treatment of DTA aneurysms.

TI  - Assessment of long-term remission in lupus nephritis patients: a retrospective
      analysis over 30 years.
PG  - 1403-7
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/kev003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the likelihood of very long-term remission in patients with 
      biopsy-proven LN attempting to identify good prognostic features. METHODS: We
      reviewed patients with LN whose renal biopsies showed World Health Organization
      (WHO) classes III, IV and V and who had a follow-up of at least 5 years between
      1973 and 2008. We analysed demographic, clinical, laboratory and therapeutic
      parameters comparing those patients with (group A) and without (group B) 5 year
      remission. RESULTS: Of 191 LN patients followed, 105 patients met the strict
      inclusion criteria. Ninety-five patients were female. Mean age at diagnosis of
      lupus was 24.1 years (s.d. 10.7). ean age at diagnosis of LN was 28.4 years (s.d.
      11.3). The mean duration of follow-up was 13.7 years (s.d. 14.1). Forty (38%)
      patients achieved 5 year remission, of whom 17 (16.2%) had remission for >/=15
      years. The incidence of flares per year from 5 to 15 years was 7.9%; however, no 
      flares were observed after 15 years of remission. The only distinguishing feature
      found in this study was the association of WHO class IV on kidney biopsy with LN 
      progression (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Renal histology with WHO class IV predicted a
      poor long-term remission rate. Age, sex, ethnicity, serological parameters and
      treatment received did not predict long-term remission. Renal flares can occur up
      to 15 years after a patient has gone into remission.

TI  - Mitoxantrone ability to induce premature senescence in human dental pulp stem
      cells and human dermal fibroblasts.
PG  - 255-66
AB  - UNLABELLED: In this study we assessed the effects of the frequently used
      chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone (MTX) on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and
      compared it with the response of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). DPSCs are
      valuable source of mesenchymal stem cells which may be extremely useful in a
      number of clinical applications. It is evident that both normal and tumor cells
      are being affected during therapy and characterization of these cells under
      genotoxic stress contributes to the evaluation of their safety usage. In the
      experiment cells were exposed to doses 5-150 nmol/l MTX. Proliferation of cells
      was detected by Z2 counter and viability by Vi-Cell XR using Trypan blue
      exclusion staining. Cell cycle analysis was determinated by flow cytometry,
      induction of apoptosis by monitoring the activities of caspases. The expression
      of key proteins was detected by Western blotting. Senescence was analyzed by
      activity of beta-galactosidase and by detection of persisting DSBs-associated
      gammaH2AX foci. Exposure of both cell types to lower concentrations of MTX
      resulted in premature senescence (SIPS), which was accompanied with typical
      morphological changes, increased activity of senescence-associated
      beta-galactosidase, persisting DSBs-associated gammaH2AX foci and cell cycle
      arrest in G2 phase. MTX provokes the activation of p53-p21(WAF1/Cip1) pathway in 
      both cell types and activates cell-cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) in HDFs, but not in
      DPSCs. Higher concentrations of MTX induced caspase-mediated apoptosis.
      CONCLUSIONS: MTX induces apoptosis or SIPS in both cell types in dependency on
      MTX doses. Both pathways prevent the proliferation of cells with damaged DNA.

TI  - Dermoid cyst of the pancreas: A rare cystic neoplasm.
PG  - 72-4
LID - 10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.10.026 [doi]
LID - S2210-2612(15)00462-9 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dermoid cyst of the pancreas, also called cystic teratoma, is a
      benign, well-differentiated, and extremely rare germ cell neoplasm. Preoperative 
      diagnosis is challenging since there are no definitive preoperative diagnostic
      tests or pathognomonic findings. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a
      54-year-old male who presented with an incidentally detected pancreatic cystic
      mass at the tail of the pancreas. Computerized tomography revealed a benign
      cystic mass such as oligocystic serous cystadenoma or a hemorrhagic cyst.
      However, a high CEA level from EUS guided aspirated fluid suggested mucinous
      cystic neoplasm. After laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, the 
      final diagnosis was confirmed as a dermoid cyst of the pancreas. CONCLUSION:
      Despite the benign nature of the dermoid cyst, complete surgical resection is
      mostly inevitable due to the difficulty of preoperative diagnosis as in the
      present case.

TI  - Functional Constipation and Constipation-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in 
      the General Population: Data from the GECCO Study.
PG  - 3186016
LID - 10.1155/2016/3186016 [doi]
AB  - Background. The prevalence of constipation in the (German) population has been
      shown to be 14.9% in a telephone survey, but more detailed data are required to
      characterize the sociographics and clinical characteristics of persons with
      different types of functional constipation, either constipation-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) or functional constipation with or without
      meeting Rome criteria. Methods. Of 2239 constipated individuals identified during
      the telephone interview, 1037 (46.3%) were willing to provide a postal address
      for a questionnaire, of which 589 (56.8%) returned the questionnaire, inquiring
      about sociographic data, clinical symptoms, and health care behavior related to
      constipation, as well as health-related quality-of-life (SF12). Subgroups of
      functionally constipated individuals were compared. Results. More than 50% of the
      respondents reported a somatic comorbid condition and/or regular medication
      intake that may contribute to constipation. We split the remaining individuals (N
      = 214) into three groups, matching Rome-criteria for IBS (IBS-C, n = 64) and for 
      functional constipation (FC-R, n = 36) and FC not matching Rome criteria (n =
      114). Nearly all sociographic and clinical characteristics were equal among them,
      and all individuals with constipation had similar and lowered QOL on the SF-12
      physical health domain, but in IBS-C the scores were also significantly lower in 
      comparison to FC-R and FC, in both the physical health and the mental health
      domain. Conclusion. Only a fraction of individuals with chronic constipation
      match Rome criteria for IBS-C or FC, but subgroups do not differ with respect to 
      most other measures except quality-of-life profiles.

TI  - Evaluation of pelvic posterior exenteration in the management of advanced-stage
      ovarian cancer.
PG  - 505-10
LID - 10.1007/s00404-009-1175-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The main aim of this study was to show the interest of pelvic posterior 
      exenteration to obtain complete resection of the tumor in case of invasion of the
      rectum by contiguity in advanced-stage ovarian cancer. The secondary aim was to
      determine the morbidity of this surgery. METHODS: It is a multicentric,
      retrospective study of a series of 41 patients, who underwent posterior
      pelvectomy for advanced-stage ovarian cancer, over a period of 18 years, from
      July 1989 to July 2007. RESULTS: The surgery resulted in macroscopically complete
      resection in 19 patients (46.34%), a residual tumor <2 cm in 19 patients (46.34%)
      and >2 cm in 3 patients (7.32%). In 34 patients (34/41), digestive continuity
      with satisfactory anal sphincter function was restored immediately or in the
      short term. The mean delay to the start of complementary treatment was 36 days.
      Median overall survival was 33 months. CONCLUSION: The main aim of surgery for
      ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis is to obtain a complete resection. In the case 
      of direct invasion of the rectum by contiguity, when there is no cleavage plane
      between the uterus and the rectum, pelvic posterior exenteration is an effective 
      method to achieve this objective. Morbidity is relatively high, but acceptable
      given the poor prognosis of this disease, the improved survival after surgery,
      and improvements in post-operative quality of life and functions.

TI  - Local and Global Task Switching Costs in Bilinguals Who Vary in Second Language
      Proficiency.
PG  - 89-106
AB  - We examined the relationship between bilinguals' second language (L2) proficiency
      and their performance on a Stroop switching task, in which a color word (e.g.,
      GREEN) appeared in a congruent ink color (e.g., green) or an incongruent ink
      color (e.g., red). Participants either read aloud the color word in the
      word-reading trials or named the ink color in the color-naming trials. Bilinguals
      who varied in L2 proficiency received 2 pure blocks, consisting of word-reading
      trials and color-naming trials, respectively, and 1 mixed block, consisting of
      intermixed word-reading and color-naming trials in an alternating-runs pattern.
      Comparing performance in nonswitch trials in the mixed block and the pure block
      provides a measure of global switch costs, whereas differences on switch trials
      and nonswitch trials in the mixed block reflect local switch costs. Bilinguals
      with higher L2 proficiency showed a marginally smaller Stroop effect in color
      naming, a smaller local switch cost in word reading (but not in color naming),
      and a smaller word-reading versus color-naming task set asymmetry in local switch
      costs. The latter result was consistent with the language switching finding that 
      the L1/L2 switch cost asymmetry decreased as a function of bilinguals' L2
      proficiency. Overall, the current findings support the facilitative role of L2
      proficiency in bilinguals' task set switching: Those with higher L2 proficiency
      have better task set shifting and reconfiguration and updating abilities when
      they switch from a more difficult task set (color naming) to an easier task set
      (word reading) in a task-switching paradigm.

TI  - Improving the retirement village to residential aged care transition.
PG  - 344-52
AB  - Older Australians living in retirement villages are an increasing community
      segment. These people make choices both about the place at which they live and
      the support needed at that place to optimise health and wellbeing. However, for
      some, unmet support needs in the retirement village may result in a transition to
      a residential aged care facility. This qualitative study explored how and why
      this transition occurs; how it might be avoided; and, when the move is
      unavoidable, how the process can be improved. Implications of these findings for 
      the retirement village and aged care sectors are discussed.

TI  - Bioluminescence Image as a Quantitative Imaging Biomarker for Preclinical
      Evaluation of Cryoablation in a Murine Model.

LID - S1051-0443(18)31042-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jvir.2018.03.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To employ bioluminescence imaging (BLI) as a quantitative imaging
      biomarker to assess preclinical evaluation of cryoablation in a murine model.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro, Colon26-Luc (C26-Luc) cells were seeded at 6
      different concentrations in 35-mm dishes. These were divided into 6 groups: group
      0 (G0), a control group without treatment; and groups 1-5 (G1-G5) according to
      the number of freeze-thaw cycles, with each cycle consisting of freezing at -80
      degrees C for 10 min followed by thawing at room temperature for 5 minutes. BLI
      and flow-cytometric analysis were performed after cryotherapy. In vivo, 20
      tumor-bearing mice with C26-Luc cells were divided into 4 groups: group 0 (G0), a
      control group; and groups 1-3 (G1-G3) according to the number of freeze-thaw
      cycles. Each cryoablation procedure was performed for 30 seconds with liquid
      nitrogen (-170 degrees C) applied with cotton-tipped applicators. BLI was
      acquired at 6 hours and 1, 3, and 7 days after treatments. RESULTS: In vitro, BLI
      signal showed a negative correlation with the number of freeze-thaw cycles (r =
      -0.86, P = .02). In vivo, there was no difference in tumor volume at 1 day after 
      cryoablation among all groups, but the BLI signals were significantly different
      between G0 and G2/G3 (P = .03 and P = .02, respectively) and between G1 and G3 (P
      = .04). BLI signals reflected tumor growth speed and survival ratio. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study demonstrates the direct validation of BLI as a quantitative tool for
      the early assessment of therapeutic effects of cryoablation.

TI  - Pilot Study Comparing Closed Versus Open Tracheal Suctioning in Postoperative
      Neonates and Infants With Complex Congenital Heart Disease.
PG  - 647-654
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000001192 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the hemodynamic effect of tracheal suction method in the
      first 36 hours after high-risk infant heart surgery on the PICU and to compare
      open and closed suctioning techniques. DESIGN: Pilot randomized crossover study. 
      SETTING: Single PICU in United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Infants undergoing surgical
      palliation with Norwood Sano, modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, or pulmonary artery
      banding in the first 36 hours postoperatively. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were
      randomized to receive open or closed (in-line) tracheal suctioning either for
      their first or second study tracheal suction in the first 36 hours
      postoperatively. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four infants were enrolled
      over 18 months, 11 after modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, seven after Norwood
      Sano, and six after pulmonary artery banding. Thirteen patients received the open
      suction method first followed by the closed suction method second, and 11
      patients received the closed suction method first followed by the open suction
      method second in the first 36 hours after their surgery. There were statistically
      significant larger changes in heart rate (p = 0.002), systolic blood pressure (p 
      = 0.022), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.009), mean blood pressure (p = 0.007), 
      and arterial saturation (p = 0.040) using the open suction method, compared with 
      closed suctioning, although none were clinically significant (defined as
      requiring any intervention). CONCLUSIONS: There were no clinically significant
      differences between closed and open tracheal suction methods; however, there were
      statistically significant greater changes in some hemodynamic variables with open
      tracheal suctioning, suggesting that closed technique may be safer in children
      with more precarious physiology.

TI  - On scaffold designing for bone regeneration: A computational multiscale approach.
PG  - 219-29
LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2008.06.021 [doi]
AB  - Scaffold design for bone tissue engineering applications involves many parameters
      that directly influence the rate of bone tissue regeneration onto its
      microstructural surface. To improve scaffold functionality, increasing interest
      is being focused on in vitro and in vivo research in order to obtain the optimal 
      scaffold design for a specific application. However, the evaluation of the effect
      of each specific scaffold parameter on tissue regeneration using these techniques
      requires costly protocols and long-term experiments. In this paper, we elucidate 
      the effect of some scaffold parameters on bone tissue regeneration by means of a 
      mathematically based approach. By virtue of in silico experiments, factors such
      as scaffold stiffness, porosity, resorption kinetics, pore size and pre-seeding
      are analyzed in a specific bone tissue application found in the literature. The
      model predicts the in vivo rate of bone formation within the scaffold, the
      scaffold degradation and the interaction between the implanted scaffold and the
      surrounding bone. Results show an increasing rate of bone regeneration with
      increasing scaffold stiffness, scaffold mean pore size and pre-seeding, whereas
      the collapse of the scaffold occurs for a faster biomaterial resorption kinetics.
      Requiring further experimental validation, the model can be useful for the
      assessment of scaffold design and for the analysis of scaffold parameters in
      tissue regeneration.

      Excited-State Femtosecond Dynamics.
PG  - 5603-5608
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b02601 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption techniques are used to explain
      the source of the intense red/near-infrared emission of crystalline
      4-dimethylamino-2'-hydroxychalcone. We found that the initially excited enol form
      undergoes tautomerization in 3 ps to form the keto tautomer. The latter is stable
      in the ground state as a consequence of J-type aggregation in the crystal packing
      and is manifested in an absorption peak at 550 nm that spectrally overlaps with
      the short-lived enol emission, leading to self-reabsorption and adding a factor
      to the complete depletion of the enol emission. Relaxation of the keto tautomer
      takes place in the form of intense fluorescence (600-750 nm) with 1.7 ns
      lifetime. The different spectroscopy in solution is due to vibrational cooling
      (300 fs), followed by solvation dynamics (5 ps in methanol) and twisting of the
      hydroxyphenyl ring (16 ps), before relaxation of the enol tautomer in the form of
      weak green fluorescence with 350 ps lifetime.

TI  - Bisoprolol in the treatment of chronic heart failure.
PG  - 431-9
AB  - Bisoprolol fumarate is a highly selective beta-1 receptor blocker. Bisoprolol has
      been extensively studied in three large mortality trials in stable chronic heart 
      failure (CHF) patients. The CIBIS trial enrolled 641 patients and demonstrated
      the good tolerability of bisoprolol in a large CHF population, without evidence
      for any harmful effect. The CIBIS-II study was the first large randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrating in 2647 patients a dramatic 
      reduction in mortality with a beta-blocking agent in CHF patients. CIBIS-III
      demonstrated in 1010 patients the equivalence of 2 different therapeutic
      strategies in de novo CHF patients. There was no difference in morbidity and
      mortality between sub-groups of patients receiving first bisoprolol or enalapril.
      These three trials also demonstrated the good tolerability of bisoprolol
      fumarate. Other studies were either limited in number of patients or not
      randomized. However, these studies confirmed the good tolerability of bisoprolol 
      in CHF patients, even in elderly population. Bisoprolol fumarate is a selective
      beta-1 receptor blocker that significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in
      stable CHF patients. Bisoprolol is well tolerated with few significant side
      effects in different large trials.

TI  - Monitoring the Photocleaving Dynamics of Colloidal MicroRNA-Functionalized Gold
      Nanoparticles Using Second Harmonic Generation.
PG  - 9983-90

AB  - Photoactivated drug delivery systems using gold nanoparticles provide the promise
      of spatiotemporal control of delivery that is crucial for applications ranging
      from regenerative medicine to cancer therapy. In this study, we use second
      harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy to monitor the light-activated controlled 
      release of oligonucleotides from the surface of colloidal gold nanoparticles.
      MicroRNA is functionalized to spherical gold nanoparticles using a nitrobenzyl
      linker that undergoes photocleaving upon ultraviolet irradiation. The SHG signal 
      generated from the colloidal nanoparticle sample is shown to be a sensitive probe
      for monitoring the photocleaving dynamics in real time. The photocleaving
      irradiation wavelength is scanned to show maximum efficiency on resonance at 365 
      nm, and the kinetics are investigated at varying irradiation powers to
      demonstrate that the nitrobenzyl photocleaving is a one-photon process.
      Additional characterization methods including electrophoretic mobility
      measurements, extinction spectroscopy, and fluorimetry are used to verify the SHG
      results, leading to a better understanding of the photocleaving dynamics for this
      model oligonucleotide therapeutic delivery system.

TI  - Polyamines Impair Immunity to Helicobacter pylori by Inhibiting L-Arginine Uptake
      Required for Nitric Oxide Production.
PG  - 1686-98, 1698.e1-6
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.06.060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Helicobacter pylori-induced immune responses fail to eradicate
      the bacterium. Nitric oxide (NO) can kill H pylori. However, translation of
      inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and NO generation by H pylori-stimulated macrophages
      is inhibited by the polyamine spermine derived from ornithine decarboxylase
      (ODC), and is dependent on availability of the iNOS substrate L-arginine (L-Arg).
      We determined if spermine inhibits iNOS-mediated immunity by reducing L-Arg
      uptake into macrophages. METHODS: Levels of the inducible cationic amino acid
      transporter (CAT)2, ODC, and iNOS were measured in macrophages and H pylori
      gastritis tissues. L-Arg uptake, iNOS expression, and NO levels were assessed in 
      cells with small interfering RNA knockdown of CAT2 or ODC, and in gastric
      macrophages. The ODC inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, was administered
      to H pylori-infected mice for 4 months after inoculation. RESULTS: H pylori
      induced CAT2 and uptake of L-Arg in RAW 264.7 or primary macrophages. Addition of
      spermine or knockdown of CAT2 inhibited L-Arg uptake, NO production, and iNOS
      protein levels, whereas knockdown of ODC had the opposite effect. CAT2 and ODC
      were increased in mouse and human H pylori gastritis tissues and localized to
      macrophages. Gastric macrophages from H pylori-infected mice showed increased ODC
      expression, and attenuated iNOS and NO levels upon ex vivo H pylori stimulation
      versus cells from uninfected mice. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine treatment of
      infected mice restored L-Arg uptake, iNOS protein expression, and NO production
      in gastric macrophages, and significantly reduced both H pylori colonization
      levels and gastritis severity. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of ODC in gastric
      macrophages impairs host defense against H pylori by suppressing iNOS-derived NO 
      production.

PG  - 181-185
LID - 10.7181/acfs.2016.17.4.181 [doi]
AB  - Panfacial bone fracture is challenging. Even experienced surgeons find
      restoration of original facial architecture difficult because of the severe
      degree of fragmentation and loss of reference segments that could guide the start
      of facial reconstruction. To restore the facial contour, surgeons usually follow 
      a general sequence for panfacial bone reduction. Among the sequences, the
      bottom-to-top and outside-in sequence is reported to be the most widely used in
      recent publications. However, a single sequence cannot be applied to all cases of
      panfacial fractures because of the variations in panfacial bone fracture
      patterns. In this article, we intend to find the reference and discuss the
      efficacy of inside-out sequence in facial bone fracture reconstruction.

PG  - 787-792
LID - 10.1111/iju.13434 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the long-term survival of transplanted kidneys in patients 
      with a continent urinary diversion. METHODS: Between January 1987 and July 2015, 
      16 patients with a median age of 37 years (range 21-63 years) underwent kidney
      transplantation on a continent urinary diversion. A total of 14 patients
      presented irreversible dysfunction of the lower urinary tract, and two patients
      had required radical cystectomy because of bladder cancer. All continent urinary 
      diversions were carried out before the transplantation. There were nine Kock
      pouches, five Mainz pouches, one Mainz neobladder and one Hautmann neobladder. A 
      total of 11 patients had a previous non-continent urinary diversion. Of the
      transplants, 14 came from brain-dead donors and two from related living donors.
      RESULTS: The median post-transplantation follow up was 171 months (range 30-298
      months). Two patients died, while six patients lost their transplant and resumed 
      hemodialysis. Nine patients (56.2%) were alive with a functional transplant at
      the end of follow up. The most common allograft complication was acute
      pyelonephritis, but no graft was lost as a result of urinary diversion
      complications. The kidney transplant survival rate was 73.3% after 10 years, and 
      66.6% after 15 years. Among patients who still had a functional transplant at the
      time of the study, creatinine clearance was >30 mL/min for seven patients and <30
      mL/min for two patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the longest series to 
      date of renal transplantation on continent urinary diversions. The long-term
      outcome shows that the presence of a continent urinary diversion does not reduce 
      transplant survival.

AB  - An outstanding current carrying performance (namely critical current density, Jc)
      over a broad temperature range of 10-77 K for magnetic fields up to 12 T is
      reported for films of YBa2Cu3O7-x with Ba2Y(Nb,Ta)O6 inclusion pinning centres
      (YBCO-BYNTO) and thicknesses in the range of 220-500 nm. Jc values of 10 MA cm-2 
      were measured at 30 K - 5 T and 10 K - 9 T with a corresponding maximum of the
      pinning force density at 10 K close to 1 TN m-3. The system is very flexible
      regarding properties and microstructure tuning, and the growth window for
      achieving a particular microstructure is wide, which is very important for
      industrial processing. Hence, the dependence of Jc on the magnetic field angle
      was readily controlled by fine tuning the pinning microstructure. Transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM) analysis highlighted that higher growth rates induce
      more splayed and denser BYNTO nanocolumns with a matching field as high as 5.2 T.
      Correspondingly, a strong peak at the B||c-axis is noticed when the density of
      vortices is lower than the nanocolumn density. YBCO-BYNTO is a very robust and
      reproducible composite system for high-current coated conductors over an extended
      range of magnetic fields and temperatures.

AB  - To examine the use of online social networking for cardiovascular care using
      Facebook. All posts and comments in a Facebook group between June 2011 and May
      2012 were reviewed, and a survey was conducted. A total of 298 members
      participated. Of the 277 wall posts, 26.7% were question posts requesting rapid
      replies, and 50.5% were interesting cases shared with other members. The median
      response time for the question posts was 16 min (IQR 8-47), which tended to
      decrease as more members joined the group. Many members (37.4%) accessed the
      group more than once a day, and more than half (64%) monitored the group posts in
      real time with automatic notifications of new posts. Most members expressed
      confidence in the content posted. Facebook enables online social networking
      between physicians in near-real time and appears to be a useful tool for
      physicians to share clinical experience and request assistance in
      decision-making.

TI  - [When gastrointestinal symptoms present, consideration should always be given to 
      celiac disease].
PG  - 46-8
AB  - Celiac disease/nontropical sprue is diagnosed too rarely and often too late. In
      the routine clinical setting, therefore, it should receive more consideration. In
      patients with gastrointestinal symptoms that prompt gastroscopy, a small bowel
      biopsy should always be obtained, for it alone detects sprue. Despite the high
      level of accuracy of antibody determination, there is no substitution for the
      demonstration of atrophic villi in biopsy material. In the absence of a
      diagnosis, a gluten-free diet should not be recommended, since in patients who
      actually have the disease, mucosal changes will regress, and confirmation of the 
      diagnosis is no longer possible. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, treatment
      comprises a life-long gluten-free diet, which not only leads to an improvement of
      the symptoms, but also eliminates the increased lymphoma risk.

AB  - Objective: To describe the self-reported prevalence of intellectual disability,
      physical, hearing and visual, according to sociodemographic variables, degree of 
      limitation and frequency of rehabilitation service use. Methods: Data from the
      National Health Survey, a population survey. the self-reported prevalence of
      physical, mental, visual and hearing were calculated and their 95% confidence
      intervals, stratified by sex, age, race / color, for Brazil, place of residence
      and Major Regions. Results: The prevalence of self-reported disability in the
      country was 6.2% (12.4 million people). The prevalence of disability was 1.3%
      higher in men, in people aged 60 or more in the Northeast. Visual impairment was 
      more prevalent (3.6%), increased with age, as well as hearing loss. Acquired
      deficiency was higher in relation to the birth (except intellectual). Lesser
      degree of limitation was observed among those who reported visual impairment and 
      the use of health services was less frequent. Conclusion: It is necessary to
      expand access to health promotion, early diagnosis and treatment, as well as
      strengthen public policies aimed at this population.

      care, and possible solutions.
PG  - 670957
LID - 10.1155/2012/670957 [doi]
AB  - Treatment of HIV-infected patients with highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART) usually results in diminished viral replication, increasing CD4(+) cell
      counts, a reversal of most immunological disturbances, and a reduction in risk of
      morbidity and mortality. However, approximately 20% of all HIV-infected patients 
      do not achieve optimal immune reconstitution despite suppression of viral
      replication. These patients are referred to as immunological nonresponders
      (INRs). INRs present with severely altered immunological functions, including
      malfunction and diminished production of cells within lymphopoetic tissue,
      perturbed frequencies of immune regulators such as regulatory T cells and Th17
      cells, and increased immune activation, immunosenescence, and apoptosis.
      Importantly, INRs have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality compared to
      HIV-infected patients with an optimal immune reconstitution. Additional treatment
      to HAART that may improve immune reconstitution has been investigated, but
      results thus far have proved disappointing. The reason for immunological
      nonresponse is incompletely understood. This paper summarizes the known and
      unknown factors regarding the incomplete immune reconstitution in HIV infection, 
      including mechanisms, relevance for clinical care, and possible solutions.

AB  - We studied the effect of gamma-irradiation on HUVEC endothelial cells co-cultured
      with allogeneic astrocytes. This 2D in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier has
      the same parameters as cerebral microvascular endothelial cells forming the
      blood-brain barrier and allows reproducing its functions in vivo. Dose-dependent 
      changes in cell morphology and violation of monolayer integrity were observed.
      Real-time PCR and immunocytochemical analysis revealed changes in the expression 
      of tight (ZO-1, claudin-5) and adherens junction protein (vascular endothelial
      cadherin, beta-catenin) mRNA. Expression of tight and adherens junction proteins 
      mRNA decreased in 2, 24, and 48 h after irradiation in doses of 2, 4, and 6 Gy.
      Significant dose-dependent changes were found only for beta-catenin mRNA
      expression in 2 h after exposition. This model of blood-brain barrier in vitro
      can be used for studying the molecular mechanisms regulating permeability of
      cerebral endothelium under normal conditions and after pathological exposures,
      e.g. gamma-irradiation.

TI  - [PEG assisted hydrothermal synthesis of LaPO4 : Eu3+ nanoparticles].
PG  - 1023-5
AB  - The present reports a hydrothermal process to synthesize the precursor of
      Eu(3+)-doped LaPO4 nanoparticles with PEG2000 used as additive. SEM shows that
      the nanoparticles are similar to spheres. The Eu(3+-)doped LaPO4 phosphor was
      characterized by powder X-ray diffractometer. According to our measurements with 
      XRD, the products belong to monoclinic monazite type, and the samples were well
      crystallized after sintering at 700 degrees C for 2 h. The effects of synthesis
      condition, sintering temperature and time on the luminescence of the samples were
      investigated. The luminescence data indicated that the optimum condition for
      synthesizing the precursor was at 180 degrees C for 14 h, and the optimum
      condition for heat-treatment of the precursor was at 850 degrees C for 1 hour.
      The effects of different contents of Eu3+ on the luminescence of LaPO4 : EuO3+
      nanoparticles were also investigated, and the results showed that the
      luminescence intensity was enhanced with the slight increase in the Eu3+ content,
      and the optimum Eu(3+)-doping concentration was 4% (mole fraction).

TI  - Analytic derivatives for perturbatively corrected "double hybrid" density
      functionals: theory, implementation, and applications.
PG  - 124115
AB  - A recently proposed new family of density functionals [S. Grimme, J. Chem. Phys. 
      124, 34108 (2006)] adds a fraction of nonlocal correlation as a new ingredient to
      density functional theory (DFT). This fractional correlation energy is calculated
      at the level of second-order many-body perturbation theory (PT2) and replaces
      some of the semilocal DFT correlation of standard hybrid DFT methods. The new
      "double hybrid" functionals (termed, e.g., B2-PLYP) contain only two empirical
      parameters that have been adjusted in thermochemical calculations on parts of the
      G2/3 benchmark set. The methods have provided the lowest errors ever obtained by 
      any DFT method for the full G3 set of molecules. In this work, the applicability 
      of the new functionals is extended to the exploration of potential energy
      surfaces with analytic gradients. The theory of the analytic gradient largely
      follows the standard theory of PT2 gradients with some additional subtleties due 
      to the presence of the exchange-correlation terms in the self-consistent field
      operator. An implementation is reported for closed-shell as well as
      spin-unrestricted reference determinants. Furthermore, the implementation
      includes external point charge fields and also accommodates continuum solvation
      models at the level of the conductor like screening model. The density fitting
      resolution of the identity (RI) approximation can be applied to the evaluation of
      the PT2 part with large gains in computational efficiency. For systems with
      approximately 500-600 basis functions the evaluation of the double hybrid
      gradient is approximately four times more expensive than the calculation of the
      standard hybrid DFT gradient. Extensive test calculations are provided for main
      group elements and transition metal containing species. The results reveal that
      the B2-PLYP functional provides excellent molecular geometries that are superior 
      compared to those from standard DFT and MP2.

TI  - Temporal Trends in Outcomes after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests Witnessed by
      Emergency Medical Services in Japan: A Population-Based Study.
PG  - 477-84
LID - 10.3109/10903127.2015.1115931 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) witnessed by
      emergency medical service (EMS) personnel has been insufficiently understood. The
      aim of this study was to evaluate temporal trends in survival after EMS-witnessed
      OHCAs in Japan. METHODS: A nationwide, population-based, observational cohort
      study of consecutive adult OHCA patients with emergency responder resuscitation
      attempts from January 2005 to December 2012 in Japan. We assessed the trends in
      annual incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of OHCA patients witnessed by EMS
      personnel. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors that 
      were potentially associated with neurologically favorable outcome defined as
      cerebral performance category scale 1or 2. RESULTS: During the study period, a
      total of 66,760 EMS-witnessed OHCAs were documented. The annual incidence rates
      per 100,000 persons of EMS-witnessed OHCA patients increased from 4.6 (n = 7219) 
      in 2005 to 4.9 (n = 9256) in 2012 (p for trend = 0.035). The proportion of
      one-month survival with neurologically favorable outcome improved from 5.9% in
      2005 to 8.6% in 2012 (p for trend < 0.001), and the proportion increased from
      22.1% in 2005 to 30.2% in 2012 in cases with shockable rhythm (p for trend <
      0.001). In a multivariate analysis, adults, male gender, shockable rhythm,
      presumed cardiac origin, and year were associated with a better neurological
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the proportion of one-month survival
      with neurologically favorable outcome among OHCA patients witnessed by EMS
      personnel significantly improved during the study period.

TI  - Human papillomavirus-associated oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC): treatment options.
PG  - 595-610
LID - 10.1007/s11864-014-0309-1 [doi]
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Human papillomavirus-associated oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) is
      growing in incidence and has distinct clinical, pathologic, molecular, and
      epidemiologic features. However, the management of HPV-OPC does not presently
      differ from HPV-negative OPC based on the current evidence and requires complex
      multidisciplinary approaches. The superior prognosis of HPV-OPC and the
      toxicities of current multimodality treatment in a young population serve as the 
      impetus to evaluate de-intensification treatment regimens aimed at reducing
      toxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Clinical trials are underway to 
      evaluate reduced doses of radiation or less toxic systemic therapy regimens in
      HPV-OPC. Minimally invasive surgical approaches in the HPV-OPC population with
      early tumor stage also are being investigated. De-intensification strategies
      should only be employed in the context of clinical trials, and HPV-OPC patients
      should be offered clinical trials' participation. Appropriate patient selection
      is critical to the development of de-intensification regimens, and this requires 
      greater understanding of risk factors within the HPV-OPC population, HPV-OPC
      biology, and how HPV modulates response to specific therapies. Smoking history
      and bulky nodal disease have been shown to impact negatively the favorable
      prognosis of HPV association. Validated biomarkers within the HPV-OPC population 
      are lacking, although alterations in the PI3K pathway and markers of immune
      response may emerge as important considerations in the future. Novel therapeutic 
      strategies are desperately needed particularly for HPV-OPC patients who fail
      definitive therapy, and select patients with recurrent or metastatic disease may 
      benefit from aggressive approaches.

TI  - The role of experimental and computational structural approaches in 7TM drug
      discovery.
PG  - 1071-84
LID - 10.1517/17460441.2015.1072166 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Starting with the published X-ray structures of ligand-mediated 7TM
      proteins in 2007, experimental approaches, led by X-ray structure determinations,
      and computational approaches, led by docking and molecular dynamics, have
      converged to elaborate our understanding of this field and demonstrate their
      effectiveness in drug discovery. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the structural
      information that has emerged for ligand-mediated 7TM proteins, including the
      class A, B, C, and F receptors, focusing on the 7TM domains for the multi-domain 
      proteins. The authors describe the key regions associated with ligand binding as 
      well as features responsible for function such as activation versus inhibition
      and biased signaling. Furthermore, the authors summarize the effectiveness of
      computational studies to help clarify the structure-function information and
      their use for drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: There is now a significant amount
      of structural information covering a range of 7TM protein classes (A, B, C, and
      F) and activation states. For these and closely related proteins, structure-based
      drug discovery has proven to be a powerful tool. More structural information is
      needed with respect to dimerization, 7TM proteins with beta-arrestin to help in
      understanding the control of biased signaling, and full-protein structure
      determinations for non-class A proteins to help in understanding and controlling 
      their functioning. Finally, the use of the existing structural information to
      target new sites on these proteins needs further exploration.

TI  - Endovascular repair or surveillance of patients with small AAA.
PG  - 496-503; discussion 504
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcome of patients with small abdominal aortic
      aneurysms (AAA) treated in a prospective trial of endovascular aneurysm repair
      (EVAR) to patients randomized to the surveillance arm of the UK Small Aneurysm
      Trial. METHOD: All patients with small AAA (< or = 5.5 cm diameter) treated with 
      a stent graft (EVARsmall) in the multicenter AneuRx clinical trial from 1997 to
      1999 were reviewed with follow up through 2003. A subgroup of patients
      (EVARmatch) who met the age (60-76 years) and aneurysm size (4.0-5.5 cm diameter)
      inclusion criteria of the UK Small Aneurysm Trial were compared to the published 
      results of the surveillance patient cohort (UKsurveil) of the UK Small Aneurysm
      Trial (NEJM 346:1445, 2002). Endpoints of comparison were aneurysm rupture, fatal
      aneurysm rupture, operative mortality, aneurysm related death and overall
      mortality. The total patient years of follow-up for EVAR patients was 1369 years 
      and for UK patients was 3048 years. Statistical comparisons of EVARmatch and
      UKsurveil patients were made for rates per 100 patient years of follow up (/100
      years) to adjust for differences in follow-up time. RESULTS: The EVARsmall group 
      of 478 patients comprised 40% of the total number of patients treated during the 
      course of the AneuRx clinical trial. The EVARmatch group of 312 patients excluded
      151 patients for age < 60 or > 76 years and 15 patients for AAA diameter < 4 cm. 
      With the exception of age, there were no significant differences between
      EVARsmall and EVARmatch in pre-operative factors or post-operative outcomes. In
      comparison to the UKsurveil group of 527 patients, the EVARmatch group was
      slightly older (70 +/- 4 vs. 69 +/- 4 years, p = 0.009), had larger aneurysms
      (5.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.4 cm, p < 0.001), fewer women (7 vs. 18%, p < 0.001), 
      and had a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension and a lower prevalence
      of smoking at baseline. Ruptures occurred in 1.6% of EVARmatch patients and 5.1% 
      of UKsurveil patients; this difference was not significant when adjusted for the 
      difference in length of follow up. Fatal aneurysm rupture rate, adjusted for
      follow up time, was four times higher in UKsurveil (0.8/100 patient years) than
      in EVARmatch (0.2/100 patient years, p < 0.001); this difference remained
      significant when adjusted for difference in gender mix. Elective operative
      mortality rate was significantly lower in EVARmatch (1.9%) than in UKsurveil
      (5.9%, p < 0.01). Aneurysm-related death rate was two times higher in UKsurveil
      (1.6/100 patient years) than in EVARmatch (0.8/100 patient years, p = 0.03).
      All-cause mortality rate was significantly higher in UKsurveil (8.3/100 patient
      years) than in EVARmatch (6.4/100 patient years, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: It
      appears that endovascular repair of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (4.0-5.5 cm)
      significantly reduces the risk of fatal aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related
      death and improves overall patient survival compared to an ultrasound
      surveillance strategy with selective open surgical repair.

TI  - Assessing the role of reward in task selection using a reward-based voluntary
      task switching paradigm.
PG  - 54-64
LID - 10.1007/s00426-017-0919-x [doi]
AB  - People exhibit a remarkable ability to both maintain controlled focus on
      executing a single task and flexibly shift between executing several tasks.
      Researchers studying human multitasking have traditionally focused on the
      cognitive control mechanisms that allow for such stable and flexible task
      execution, but there has been a recent interest in how cognitive control
      mechanisms drive the decision of task selection. The present research
      operationalizes a foraging analogy to investigate what factors drive the decision
      to either exploit task repetitions or explore task switches. A novel
      paradigm-reward-based voluntary task switching-ascribes point values to tasks
      where the overall goal is to accumulate points as quickly as possible. The reward
      structure generally rewards switching tasks, thereby juxtaposing the motivation
      to gain increased reward (by exploring task switches) against the motivation to
      perform quickly (by exploiting task repetitions). Results suggest that people are
      highly sensitive to changes in both reward and effort demands when making task
      selections, and that the task selection process is efficient and flexible. We
      argue that a cost-benefit mechanism might underlie decisions in multitasking
      contexts, whereby people compute task selections based on both the reward
      available for selecting a task and the effort necessary to execute a task.

TI  - Risk factors for extraophthalmic involvement and treatment outcomes in patients
      with IgG4-related ophthalmic disease.
PG  - 736-741

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To analyse the clinical risk factors for extraophthalmic
      involvement and treatment outcomes in patients with IgG4-related ophthalmic
      disease (IgG4-ROD) in Korea. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records
      of 42 patients diagnosed with IgG4-ROD confirmed by a surgical biopsy during the 
      7-year period, between January 2009 and March 2015, at three tertiary referral
      centres in Korea. Data regarding patients' demographics, clinical characteristics
      and radiological findings were obtained. The relapse rate was compared between
      systemic steroids only and combined immunosuppressant therapy. RESULTS: The mean 
      patient age was 55.2 years (male:female ratio, 1:1). Based on the primary orbital
      structure affected, the IgG4-RODs were classified as dacryoadenitis (52.4%),
      orbital soft tissue inflammation (21.4%), trigeminal nerve involvement (11.9%)
      and myositis (9.5%). Extraophthalmic involvement (n=21) was associated with
      bilateral involvement (p=0.004), longer symptom duration (p=0.033) and a higher
      serum IgG4 level (p=0.034). Initial treatment regimens included attentive
      observation (n=7), prednisolone alone (n=22) and prednisolone plus
      immunosuppressive agent (n=13). During follow-up (mean, 24 months), 13 patients
      (37.1%) experienced relapse. In the extraophthalmic involvement group, steroid
      therapy alone resulted in a significantly higher relapse rate than combined
      immunosuppressant treatment (p=0.028). CONCLUSION: Bilateral involvement, longer 
      symptom duration and higher IgG4 levels were significant risk factors for
      extraophthalmic involvement in Korean patients with IgG4-ROD. In patients with an
      extraophthalmic involvement, prednisolone combined with an immunosuppressive
      agent was more effective for preventing recurrence than prednisolone alone.

TI  - Evaluation of stroke volume variations obtained with the pressure recording
      analytic method.
PG  - 1186-91
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0b013e31823bc632 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether stroke volume variations obtained with the
      pressure recording analytic method can predict fluid responsiveness in
      mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory failure. DESIGN: Prospective
      study. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: 
      Thirty-five mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory failure for whom
      the decision to give fluid was taken by the physician were included. Exclusion
      criteria were: Arrhythmia, tidal volume <8 mL/kg, left ventricular ejection
      fraction<50%, right ventricular dysfunction, and heart rate/respiratory rate
      ratio <3.6. INTERVENTIONS: Fluid challenge with 500 mL of saline over 15 mins.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Stroke volume variations and cardiac output
      obtained with a pressure recording analytic method, pulse pressure variations,
      and cardiac output estimated by echocardiography were recorded before and after
      volume expansion. Patients were defined as responders if stroke volume obtained
      using echocardiography increased by >/=15% after volume expansion. Nineteen
      patients responded to the fluid challenge. Median [interquartile range, 25% to
      75%] stroke volume variation values at baseline were not different in responders 
      and nonresponders (10% [8-16] vs. 14% [12-16]), whereas pulse pressure variations
      were significantly higher in responders (17% [13-19] vs. 7% [5-10]; p < .0001). A
      12.6% stroke volume variations threshold discriminated between responders and
      nonresponders with a sensitivity of 63% (95% confidence interval 38% to 84%) and 
      a specificity of 69% (95% confidence interval 41% to 89%). A 10% pulse pressure
      variation threshold discriminated between responders and nonresponders with a
      sensitivity of 89% (95% confidence interval 67% to 99%) and a specificity of 88% 
      (95% confidence interval 62% to 98%). The area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curves was different between pulse pressure variations (0.95; 95% 
      confidence interval 0.82-0.99) and stroke volume variations (0.60; 95% confidence
      interval 0.43-0.76); p < .0001). Volume expansion-induced changes in cardiac
      output measured using echocardiography or pressure recording analytic method were
      not correlated (r = 0.14; p > .05) and the concordance rate of the direction of
      change in cardiac output was 60%. CONCLUSION: Stroke volume variations obtained
      with a pressure recording analytic method cannot predict fluid responsiveness in 
      intensive care unit patients under mechanical ventilation. Cardiac output
      measured by this device is not able to track changes in cardiac output induced by
      volume expansion.

TI  - Assessment of potentially reactive pools of aluminium in poor forest soils using 
      two methods of fractionation analysis.
PG  - 1807-16
AB  - The research was carried out in a pine-covered area of the Wielkopolski National 
      Park (Poland), for years exposed to acid rain. The soils under study are sands
      and loamy sands with a pH of 3.3-4.4. To assess potentially reactive pools of
      aluminium in those soils, two methods were employed: sequential and single
      extraction. For the exchangeable form the results obtained by single extraction
      using KCl greatly exceeded the figures yielded by sequential extraction, in which
      the conditions under which the process was executed (pH 7) led to an
      underestimation of the results. The soil profile displayed a lithogenically
      dichotomous structure which was reflected in the aluminium content, especially in
      Al extracted by pyrophosphate (single extraction) and in the so-called oxidisable
      fraction (sequential extraction). In both cases there was a jump in Al
      concentrations resulted from the release of aluminium from interlayer spaces of
      clay minerals. The labile percentage obtained for mean values in the profile
      amounted from 8.1% for single extraction to 12.1% for sequential extraction,
      which may indicate the metal's considerable pool of potentially reactive
      aluminium. Single extraction seems to be more reliable in evaluating Al forms.

TI  - Fast-axis orientation dependence on driving voltage for a Stokes polarimeter
      based on concrete liquid-crystal variable retarders.
PG  - 4278-83
LID - 10.1364/AO.49.004278 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays liquid-crystal variable retarders (LCVRs) are widely used in optical
      systems because of their capacity to provide a controlled variable optical
      retardance by means of an applied voltage, without the need of any moving
      mechanical part. Nevertheless, the main disadvantages of these components,
      reported by users in several papers, are the necessity of using a temperature
      control system for precise measurements, the degradation under UV irradiation,
      and the lack of spatial retardance homogeneity. In this paper, we report that the
      orientation of the LCVR fast axis may also be dependent on applied voltage. The
      consideration of this phenomenon improves the performances of an imaging
      polarimeter. In this work, we present the problem, introduce the method of
      calibration that was used for the experiment, and discuss the results.

TI  - GHEP-ISFG collaborative exercise on mixture profiles (GHEP-MIX06). Reporting
      conclusions: Results and evaluation.

AB  - One of the main goals of the Spanish and Portuguese-Speaking Group of the
      International Society for Forensic Genetics (GHEP-ISFG) is to promote and
      contribute to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge in the
      field of forensic genetics. Due to this fact, GHEP-ISFG holds different working
      commissions that are set up to develop activities in scientific aspects of
      general interest. One of them, the Mixture Commission of GHEP-ISFG, has organized
      annually, since 2009, a collaborative exercise on analysis and interpretation of 
      autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) mixture profiles. Until now, six exercises
      have been organized. At the present edition (GHEP-MIX06), with 25 participant
      laboratories, the exercise main aim was to assess mixture profiles results by
      issuing a report, from the proposal of a complex mock case. One of the
      conclusions obtained from this exercise is the increasing tendency of
      participating laboratories to validate DNA mixture profiles analysis following
      international recommendations. However, the results have shown some differences
      among them regarding the edition and also the interpretation of mixture profiles.
      Besides, although the last revision of ISO/IEC 17025:2017 gives indications of
      how results should be reported, not all laboratories strictly follow their
      recommendations. Regarding the statistical aspect, all those laboratories that
      have performed statistical evaluation of the data have employed the likelihood
      ratio (LR) as a parameter to evaluate the statistical compatibility. However, LR 
      values obtained show a wide range of variation. This fact could not be attributed
      to the software employed, since the vast majority of laboratories that performed 
      LR calculation employed the same software (LRmixStudio). Thus, the final allelic 
      composition of the edited mixture profile and the parameters employed in the
      software could explain this data dispersion. This highlights the need, for each
      laboratory, to define through internal validations its criteria for editing and
      interpreting mixtures, and to continuous train in software handling.

PG  - 30-9
AB  - An analysis of polymorphism of the fragment of the control region of
      mitochondrial DNA of 53 tissue samples of the brown bear Ursus arctos from
      several regions of the eastern part of Russia was carried out. It was found that 
      most of the described haplotypes belong to cluster 3a, the most common in
      Eurasia, and do not form regionally specific haplogroups. However, among the
      bears from Western and Eastern Siberia, as well as the island of Kunashir, three 
      haplotypes were identified, which are close to the haplogroup typical of Eastern 
      Hokkaido bears. The assumption was made of the existence in Siberia and the Far
      East of one or more Pleistocene refugia.

TI  - Immunophenotypic patterns of childhood acute leukemias in Indonesia.
PG  - 3381-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunophenotyping, as suggested by WHO, may improve diagnosis of
      childhood leukemia since it offers a better classification of the hematopoietic
      lineage of malignant cells as compared to morphology. Therefore, we aimed to
      determine the proportion of the immunophenotypic subtypes of acute leukemia in
      Indonesian children. METHODS: Samples were obtained from patients (0-14 years of 
      age) in 4 hospitals in Indonesia. We analyzed 541 suspected leukemia samples
      presented over a 4-year period (March 2006 - July 2010) by flow cytometry.
      Immunophenotyping allowed classification into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
      ALL (B-lineage and T-lineage ALL). RESULTS: Of 541 samples, 136 were tested using
      a single color method and 405 with a three-color method. Concordance with
      morphology was very good (?=0.82) using the three-color method with a panel of 15
      monoclonal antibodies (n=387). A relatively high percentage of acute leukemia was
      classified as AML (23%). Of the ALL samples 83% were B-lineage ALL and 17% T-
      lineage ALL. Nine out of 239 morphological ALL were labeled AML, and 12/79
      morphological AML were in fact ALL. CONCLUSION: Immunophenotyping in a
      multi-center study proved feasible and appears particularly important for
      prognostic assessment of childhood leukemia in low income countries such as
      Indonesia.

TI  - Production of N-acyl Homoserine Lactones and Virulence Factors of Waterborne
      Aeromonas hydrophila.
PG  - 264-8
LID - 10.1007/s12088-013-0381-4 [doi]
AB  - Aeromonads are inhabitants of aquatic ecosystems and are described as being
      involved in intestinal disturbances and other infections. The purpose of this
      study was to investigate the production of N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal
      molecules and some virulence factors, including hemolysins, proteases,
      extracellular nucleases production and cytotoxicity by waterborne Aeromonas
      hydrophila. A total of 24 strains isolated from fresh-water or diseased fish were
      used in the study. The majority A.hydrophila strains produce two AHL molecules
      (21/24), one is N-butanoyl homoserine lactone (BHL), and the other is N-hexanoyl 
      homoserine lactone (HHL) according to thin-layer chromatography analysis. Among
      the virulence factors tested, more than 83 % of the isolates produced beta
      haemolysin when inoculated on sheep blood agar, only 50 % of the isolates
      displayed DNase activity, 75 % of the isolates shown proteolytic activity on
      skimmed milk plate, and cytotoxic activity was detected in 20 of 24 of the
      isolates. The strains producing AHLs possessed one or more virulence factors. In 
      conclusion, the production of quorum sensing signal molecules is common among the
      strains that we examined, and there seems to some relationships between quorum
      sensing signal production and virulence factors in A. hydrophila.

AB  - The esterase B (EstB) from Sphingobium sp. SM42, which was previously reported to
      be active towards dibutyl phthalate, can cleave some small aromatic ring side
      chains from cephalosporin derivatives. A new name, de-arenethiolase, has been
      proposed to represent this activity. We present the in vitro characterization of 
      the activity of purified EstB toward cephalosporin substrates. Interestingly,
      EstB was highly active against cefoperazone and cefazolin resulting in 83 and 67%
      decreases in killing zone diameter, respectively. EstB also demonstrated a
      moderate activity towards ceftriaxone (18%) and cefotaxime (16%) while exhibiting
      no activity against cephalosporin C and cefixime. HPLC analysis indicated that
      EstB catalyzed the cleavage of the C-S bond found in cephalosporin derivatives to
      release the corresponding free aromatic ring side chains.

TI  - [Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with liver metastasis].
PG  - 521-4
AB  - For the patients who have colorectal cancer with liver metastasis, synchronous
      resection or staged surgery for primary colorectal tumor and liver metastasis is 
      usually needed which is associated with significant trauma. The role of
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been established and its application in
      colorectal cancer with liver metastasis increases gradually. Laparoscopic surgery
      for colorectal liver metastasis as a minimally invasive approach should also
      follow the oncological principles of colorectal liver metastasis, and the
      appropriate timing for laparoscopic surgery should be individualized. With the
      development of the laparoscopic surgery, more patients will benefit from
      minimally invasive surgery for colorectal liver metastasis.

TI  - Mechanism of photocatalytic activity improvement of AgNPs/TiO2 by oxygen plasma
      irradiation.
PG  - 17004-17011
AB  - Plasmonic metal Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) on TiO2 thin films (AgNPs/TiO2) are a
      kind of excellent photocatalyst of high efficiency under visible light, and thus 
      draw great interest nowadays. Further improvement of their photocatalytic
      activity (PA) is difficult but is of high importance for their applications. In
      this paper, oxygen plasma was taken to partially oxidize AgNPs deposited on the
      surface of TiO2 to form a structure with the configuration of a p-type
      semiconductor/plasmonic metal/n-type semiconductor (Ag2O/AgNPs/TiO2). The
      localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the AgNPs was strongly damped after
      oxygen plasma irradiation (OPI) but the photocatalytic activity was improved. The
      mechanisms of the photocatalytic activity improvement under UV and visible light 
      were explored based on charge kinetics.

TI  - Adding low-dose estrogen to the hormone-free interval: impact on bleeding
      patterns in users of a 91-day extended regimen oral contraceptive.
PG  - 350-5
LID - 10.1016/j.contraception.2008.11.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cross-study analysis of contraceptive clinical trials for two
      different 91-day oral contraceptive (OC) regimens was performed to examine the
      impact on bleeding patterns when supplementing the 7-day hormone-free interval
      with 10 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE) daily. STUDY DESIGN: Two separate 1-year Phase
      3 clinical programs were conducted using similar study designs. The percentages
      of subjects reporting bleeding and spotting using electronic diaries for each
      91-day cycle were compared. RESULTS: Scheduled bleeding with the EE regimen was
      less than that reported with the regimen utilizing placebo during Days 85-91,
      with significant differences noted for all four 91-day cycles. Unscheduled
      bleeding decreased more quickly with the 91-day regimen containing low-dose EE in
      place of placebo, with significant differences noted during the third cycle.
      CONCLUSIONS: This cross-study comparison suggests that the administration of
      low-dose estrogen in place of placebo in a 91-day extended regimen OC improves
      the bleeding profile.

TI  - Analysis of outer membrane vesicle associated proteins isolated from the plant
      pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris.
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-8-87 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are released from the outer membrane
      of many Gram-negative bacteria. These extracellular compartments are known to
      transport compounds involved in cell-cell signalling as well as virulence
      associated proteins, e.g. the cytolysine from enterotoxic E. coli. RESULTS: We
      have demonstrated that Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) releases OMVs 
      into the culture supernatant during growth. A proteome study identified 31
      different proteins that associate with the OMV fraction of which half are
      virulence-associated. A comparison with the most abundant outer membrane (OM)
      proteins revealed that some proteins are enriched in the OMV fraction. This may
      be connected to differences in the LPS composition between the OMVs and the OM.
      Furthermore, a comparison of the OMV proteomes from two different culture media
      indicated that the culture conditions have an impact on the protein composition. 
      Interestingly, the proteins that are common to both culture conditions are mainly
      involved in virulence. CONCLUSION: Outer membrane vesicles released from the OM
      of Xcc contain membrane- and virulence-associated proteins. Future experiments
      will prove whether these structures can serve as "vehicles" for the transport of 
      virulence factors into the host membrane.

TI  - Epidemiology of obesity and chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 325-35
AB  - The obesity epidemic has reached nephrology in the form of increasing numbers of 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused by obesity-related metabolic
      disorders, IgA nephropathy, stone disease, and a unique glomerulopathy now known 
      as obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). Obesity has been identified as an
      independent risk factor for CKD, and patients with central adiposity or high
      waist-to-hip ratios appear to have the highest risk. The metabolic syndrome is a 
      risk factor for albuminuria and CKD, and studies now show that the risk of CKD
      increases with increased numbers of components of the metabolic syndrome. Obesity
      is not just a bystander or accelerator of other kidney diseases, but has unique
      histopathologic characteristics that can cause progressive kidney disease. ORG
      may accompany and worsen IgA nephropathy, urate nephropathy, and possibly even
      diabetic nephropathy. The origins of obesity-related kidney disease can be traced
      to insufficient glomerular complement from birth, and low birth weight may be an 
      important precursor to obesity and its many comorbidities. Intervention
      strategies may need to target prenatal care through the elderly to combat this
      problematic epidemic.

TI  - Impact of l-carnitine supplementation on metabolic profiles in premature infants.
PG  - 566-571
LID - 10.1038/jp.2016.253 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the influence that of l-carnitine supplementation on
      acylcarnitine (AC) profiles and hospital outcomes in premature infants. STUDY
      DESIGN: This study is a secondary analysis of previously reported work. Metabolic
      profiles were obtained using standard newborn techniques on infants born between 
      23 and 31 completed weeks of gestation. The profiles were drawn within the first 
      24 h after birth and on approximately days 7, 28 and 42 of life, or at the time
      of discharge. A single, central, contract laboratory analyzed and managed the
      samples. RESULTS: We studied 995 patients; none was subsequently diagnosed with
      an inborn error of metabolism. l-Carnitine was added to parenteral nutrition in
      390 (39%) study subjects; 592 (60%) did not receive supplementation.
      Non-supplemented infants were more likely to develop low levels of free carnitine
      (FC; <7 mum) on day 28; (41% vs 5%, P<0.01); and FC values were lower on day 7.
      Despite higher levels of FC and fewer patients with significant carnitine
      deficiencies, we found no evidence that l-carnitine supplementation was
      associated with improved short-term hospital outcomes. CONCLUSION: l-Carnitine
      supplementation is common in prematurely born neonates and is associated with
      higher carnitine levels, but is not associated with improved short-term hospital 
      outcomes.

TI  - Evaluating Exercise as Evidence-Based Practice for Individuals with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 290
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2016.00290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the
      literature to evaluate empirical support for the use of exercise as an
      evidence-based practice (EBP) for individuals with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD), aged 1-21 years, using the Adapted Physical Activity Taxonomy (APAT) (1). 
      METHOD: A systematic review of research, published within the past 10 years and
      accessible in SPORTDiscus, ProQuest Nursing, Science Direct, ERIC, Ovid MEDLINE, 
      and PsychINFO databases, was conducted following seven inclusion criteria. An
      initial 169 articles were identified of which 23 articles were found that met the
      inclusion criteria including implementation of an exercise intervention for
      participants diagnosed with ASD and utilization of an experimental/quasi
      experimental, correlational, single-subject, or qualitative research design.
      These 23 articles were evaluated using the APAT to determine the quality of the
      research and the strength of the recommendation in establishing exercise as an
      EBP. RESULTS: Of the 23 articles evaluated, 17 employed an experimental/quasi
      experimental design, 1 article employed a correlational design, and 5 articles
      employed a single-subject design. Only one article (2) was found to meet the
      minimum overall quality indicator of moderate (i.e., Level 2) when evaluated on
      the APAT. In total, 13 of the 23 articles (57%) had method sections evaluated as 
      weak, and 17 of the 23 articles (74%) had results sections evaluated as weak.
      CONCLUSION: From the findings of this systematic review, and in accordance with
      the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (3) definition of an EBP, it appears that 
      exercise can be considered an EBP for school-aged children with ASD. However,
      this recommendation is based solely on moderate evidence from one well-designed
      and well-implemented experimental study; therefore, generalization is still
      pending further similar findings. Recommendations for future research are
      offered.

PG  - 126-135
LID - 10.1099/ijs.0.64221-0 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this project was to isolate representative Fe(III)-reducing bacteria 
      from kaolin clays that may influence iron mineralogy in kaolin. Two novel
      dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, strains G12(T) and G13(T), were isolated
      from sedimentary kaolin strata in Georgia (USA). Cells of strains G12(T) and
      G13(T) were motile, non-spore-forming regular rods, 1-2 mum long and 0.6 mum in
      diameter. Cells had one lateral flagellum. Phylogenetic analyses using the 16S
      rRNA gene sequence of the novel strains demonstrated their affiliation to the
      genus Geobacter. Strain G12(T) was most closely related to Geobacter pelophilus
      (94.7 %) and Geobacter chapellei (94.1 %). Strain G13(T) was most closely related
      to Geobacter grbiciae (95.3 %) and Geobacter metallireducens (95.1 %). Based on
      phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic differences between the novel isolates and
      other closely related species of the genus Geobacter, the isolates are proposed
      as representing two novel species, Geobacter argillaceus sp. nov. (type strain
      G12(T)=ATCC BAA-1139(T)=JCM 12999(T)) and Geobacter pickeringii sp. nov. (type
      strain G13(T)=ATCC BAA-1140(T)=DSM 17153(T)=JCM 13000(T)). Another isolate,
      strain R7(T), was derived from a primary kaolin deposit in Russia. The cells of
      strain R7(T) were motile, spore-forming, slightly curved rods, 0.6 x 2.0-6.0
      microm in size and with up to six peritrichous flagella. Strain R7(T) was capable
      of reducing Fe(III) only in the presence of a fermentable substrate. 16S rRNA
      gene sequence analysis demonstrated that this isolate is unique, showing less
      than 92 % similarity to bacteria of the Sporomusa-Pectinatus-Selenomomas phyletic
      group, including 'Anaerospora hongkongensis' (90.2 %), Acetonema longum (90.6 %),
      Dendrosporobacter quercicolus (90.9 %) and Anaerosinus glycerini (91.5 %). On the
      basis of phylogenetic analysis and physiological tests, strain R7(T) is proposed 
      to represent a novel genus and species, Pelosinus fermentans gen. nov., sp. nov. 
      (type strain R7(T)=DSM 17108(T)=ATCC BAA-1133(T)), in the
      Sporomusa-Pectinatus-Selenomonas group.

AB  - Background: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common
      carcinoma worldwide. Clinical treatment for patients with CSCC remains non-ideal.
      Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), a member of the
      insulin-like growth (IGF) system, participates in several biological processes,
      including cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Here, we explored the functional 
      role of IGFBP3 in apoptosis and proliferation of A431 cells, a human CSCC cell
      line. Materials and methods: Differential expression analysis,
      immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, TUNEL assay, and CCK8 assay techniques were
      used to investigate the IGFBP3 expression levels in both A431 cells and CSCC
      tissue surgically obtained from humans as well as to explore the functional role 
      of IGFBP3 in the apoptosis and proliferation of A431 cells. Results: By using
      normal epidermal keratinocytes for comparison, we identified the top 10 ranked
      differentially upregulated genes expressed in human cutaneous squamous cell
      carcinoma cell lines. Among these 10 genes, IGFBP3 was ranked number 1. By using 
      immunohistochemistry, we found that the expression level of IGFBP3 was
      significantly elevated in CSCC tissue compared with that in normal human skin
      tissue. Knockdown of IGFBP3 in A431 cells by transfection with IGFBP3-specific
      siRNA markedly altered the expression of proteins that contribute to apoptosis
      via mitochondrial pathways, significantly suppressing the expression of Bax and
      active caspase-3, while significantly increasing B-cell lymphoma-2 expression.
      TUNEL assay confirmed the effect of knockdown of IGFBP3 on the apoptosis as well.
      In addition, knockdown of IGFBP3 inhibited the proliferation of A431 cells.
      Conclusion: IGFBP3 is overexpressed in both CSCC cell lines and tissue. Knockdown
      of IGFBP3 enhanced the apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway and inhibited the
      proliferation of A431 cells. These findings indicate that IGFBP3 may be a
      biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for CSCC.

      analysis].
PG  - 33-41
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study is to establish an interaction between serum
      VEGF1 levels and possibilities of early detection of preeclampsia. METHODS: For a
      period of three months we follow up 17 patients with preeclampsia in second
      trimester by measuring serum levels of VEGF1, PIGF and Inhibin A. A correlation
      between them was determined. RESULTS: During our study we investigate 17 patients
      with preeclampsia and 35 as a control group. Significant differences between
      serum levels in too groups were established. Serum levels for VEGF1 above 158.5
      pg/ml; Inhibin A above 98.50 ng/ml; PIGF levels above 30.01 pg/ml shows a
      diagnostic sensitivity 88.895 and diagnostic specificity 97.06% in prediction of 
      preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: Measurement of serum VEGF1, PIGF and Inhibin A levels
      are suitable for early prediction of possibilities for preeclampsia in second
      trimester. These results are the basis for further studies in this field.

TI  - AMG 176, a Selective MCL1 Inhibitor, Is Effective in Hematologic Cancer Models
      Alone and in Combination with Established Therapies.
PG  - 1582-1597
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-0387 [doi]
AB  - The prosurvival BCL2 family member MCL1 is frequently dysregulated in cancer. To 
      overcome the significant challenges associated with inhibition of MCL1
      protein-protein interactions, we rigorously applied small-molecule conformational
      restriction, which culminated in the discovery of AMG 176, the first selective
      MCL1 inhibitor to be studied in humans. We demonstrate that MCL1 inhibition
      induces a rapid and committed step toward apoptosis in subsets of hematologic
      cancer cell lines, tumor xenograft models, and primary patient samples. With the 
      use of a human MCL1 knock-in mouse, we demonstrate that MCL1 inhibition at active
      doses of AMG 176 is tolerated and correlates with clear pharmacodynamic effects, 
      demonstrated by reductions in B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Furthermore,
      the combination of AMG 176 and venetoclax is synergistic in acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) tumor models and in primary patient samples at tolerated doses.
      These results highlight the therapeutic promise of AMG 176 and the potential for 
      combinations with other BH3 mimetics. SIGNIFICANCE: AMG 176 is a potent,
      selective, and orally bioavailable MCL1 inhibitor that induces a rapid commitment
      to apoptosis in models of hematologic malignancies. The synergistic combination
      of AMG 176 and venetoclax demonstrates robust activity in models of AML at
      tolerated doses, highlighting the promise of BH3-mimetic combinations in
      hematologic cancers.See related commentary by Leber et al., p. 1511.This article 
      is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1494.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spanish is the second-most common language spoken in the United
      States, and Spanish speakers represent one third of the aging population. The
      National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set implemented a Spanish
      neuropsychological battery. Previous work described the neuropsychological
      performance for English speakers. Here we describe performance on the Spanish
      version. METHODS: Data from 276 Spanish speakers with normal cognition were
      summarized, with descriptive tables of performance on individual cognitive tests.
      Regression techniques were used to evaluate the effect of demographics on
      cognitive performance. RESULTS: Spanish speakers were younger (70.0 vs 74.0
      years) and less educated (10.7 vs 15.7 years) with more females (76% vs 63%
      female) than the previously described English speakers. Higher education and
      lower age were associated with better performance. CONCLUSION: This national
      cohort of well-characterized Spanish-speaking elders provides descriptive data on
      cognitive performance, an important tool for clinical and research efforts.

TI  - Vitamin E succinate reduces ischemia/reperfusion injury in steatotic livers.
PG  - 3327-9
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.06.076 [doi]
AB  - Steatotic livers represent a growing proportion of marginal organs available for 
      transplantation. These livers are highly prone to primary nonfunction following
      transplantation and are therefore routinely turned down for surgery. Given the
      elevated levels and sensitivity for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these
      livers, we evaluated whether pretreatment with a targeted ROS scavenger, vitamin 
      E succinate, increased survival and decreased injury after ischemia/reperfusion
      (I/R). For this study, ob/ob mice received 50 IU/d vitamin E succinate in
      supplemented vs control chow for 7 days, and were subjected to 15 minutes of
      total hepatic ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion. Treatment resulted in a
      5-fold decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels after reperfusion,
      mirrored by significant decreases in hepatocellular necrosis. These results
      suggested that targeted antioxidants such as vitamin E succinate may prove to be 
      highly applicable for the pretreatment of steatotic donor livers, increasing
      their tolerance for I/R and the transplantation process.

TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of Lophophora williamsii by loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification.
PG  - 887-91
AB  - We have developed a convenient method for the detection of Lophophora williamsii 
      using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). We designed six
      species-specific primers for L. williamsii, including two loop primers. This L.
      williamsii-specific primer set was used for LAMP of total DNA extracted from L.
      williamsii and from L. diffusa. Real-time monitoring of LAMP was achieved by
      measuring turbidity due to the formation of magnesium pyrophosphate.
      Amplification occurred in samples mixed with total DNA from L. williamsii, but
      not in those mixed with total DNA from L. diffusa. We could also visually observe
      L. williamsii by adding fluorescent detection reagent to the reaction tube and
      exposing it to UV light. This new method amplified L. williamsii selectively and 
      is expected to be applicable to the detection of peyote.

TI  - Critical Appraisal of the Treatment Planning Performance of Volumetric Modulated 
      Arc Therapy by Means of a Dual Layer Stacked Multileaf Collimator for Head and
      Neck, Breast, and Prostate.
PG  - 1533033818803882
LID - 10.1177/1533033818803882 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To ascertain whether a new delivery system (the Halcyon system) equipped
      with dual-layer stacked multileaf collimator operating in a mode, which allows
      independent, fully interdigitating motion of both layers and 6 flattening filter 
      free energy, could generate plans of high clinical quality compared to a
      well-established delivery system with single layer multileaf collimator. METHODS:
      Twenty patients in each of the 3 groups (advanced head and neck, breast, and
      high-risk prostate) were selected for an in silico planning study. For each
      patient, reference plans were developed for volumetric modulated arc therapy
      technique with 6 MV photon beams from a TrueBeam linear accelerator and compared 
      against the corresponding plans for the Halcyon system. Plan comparison was
      performed in terms of dose volume histogram quantitative analysis. RESULTS:
      Concerning the planning target volumes, with identical dose calculation and
      optimization algorithms and with identical planning techniques, no clinically
      relevant difference in coverage (D98%), hot spot (D2%), or homogeneity was
      observed. Similarly, for all the organs at risk, the dosimetric findings showed
      that (1) all planning constraints were met by the 2 delivery systems and (2)
      although statistical significant differences were reported for most of the
      parameters but none of these were judged of potential clinical relevance.
      CONCLUSION: The data presented confirmed that the new delivery system can
      generate treatment plans for volumetric modulated arc therapy with the same
      dosimetric quality of what is achievable with other systems routinely used in the
      clinics without significantly changing the current practice. Additional studies
      which customize the optimization parameters for each delivery device would
      complement the spectrum of investigations.

TI  - Measuring appetitive responding with the postauricular reflex.
PG  - 491-7
AB  - Recent research has provided evidence that the postauricular reflex (PAR) is
      potentiated while people view pleasant images relative to unpleasant and neutral 
      images. The present study sought to extend these findings by investigating
      whether the PAR is more robustly modulated by the appetitive salience of the
      stimuli. Eyeblink startle and PAR responses of 51 participants were recorded
      while they viewed images that varied in valence and thematic content.
      Participants displayed significantly greater mean PAR magnitude during
      appetitive-related images (e.g., food, erotica, families) compared with
      non-appetitive-related pleasant images. These findings support the contention
      that the PAR is a useful tool for measuring appetitive responding in humans.

      intermediate gastropod hosts from Uzbekistan.
PG  - 236-243
LID - 10.1017/S0022149X16000171 [doi]
AB  - Morphological analysis of lungworms collected among Caprinae from Uzbekistan
      resulted in the identification of four species of Protostrongylidae:
      Protostrongylus rufescens, Protostrongylus hobmaieri, Spiculocaulus leuckarti and
      Cystocaulus ocreatus. The following species were recorded as definitive hosts:
      Ovis aries, Ovis ammon, Ovis vignei, Capra hircus, Capra falconeri and Capra
      sibirica. The prevalence of P. rufescens reached 45.3%, followed by S. leuckarti 
      and C. ocreatus with 31.7% and P. hobmaieri with 16.9%. The sex ratio ranged
      between 1:3.1 and 1:6.2, with P. hobmaieri showing the strongest predominance of 
      females over males. The prevalence of infection of small ruminants with
      protostrongylid nematodes increased with the age of the hosts. Protostrongyles
      use terrestrial gastropods as intermediate hosts, and infective larvae were found
      in the species Vallonia costata, Gibbulinopsis signata, Pupilla muscorum,
      Pseudonapaeus albiplicata, Pseudonapaeus sogdiana, Leucozonella ferghanica,
      Xeropicta candacharica, Candaharia levanderi and Macrochlamys sogdiana. Xeropicta
      candacharica was the most abundant gastropod and had the highest prevalence of
      infection with protostrongylids. Adult X. candacharica had a significantly higher
      infection intensity than juveniles. The epidemiology of protostrongylid
      infections is dynamic and subject to considerable changes. Further
      characterization of the interaction of protostrongylid parasites with their
      terrestrial gastropods as intermediate hosts and Caprinae as definitive hosts is 
      required to understand these processes and to monitor the effects of changing
      ecological contexts.

TI  - [Dual-thermotherapy for parenchymal hepatic cells carcinoma].
PG  - 125-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of transhepatic arterial
      "dual-thermotherapy" (DT) for parenchymal hepatic cells carcinoma. METHODS: Fifty
      patients (mean age 55.5 years, DT group) with parenchymal hepatic cells carcinoma
      were treated with transhepatic arterial thermochemotherapy with warmed lipiodol
      (80 degrees C) and warmed chemotherapeutic agents (50 degrees C). Another 50
      patients (mean age 54 years) were treated with ordinary transhepatic arterial
      chemomembolization (TACE) with the same chemotherapeutic drugs but without
      warming (TACE group). RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 77.6%, 
      53.1% and 46.1%, respectively, in TD group; and 54.4%, 24.2% and 16.1%,
      resectively, in TACE group; the difference was statistically significant(P<0.05).
      The sidejeffect of the feeling of cauterization (cases/persistence time) in DT
      group was statistically significant compared with TACE group (P<0.05), and the
      difference was not statistically significant about other side-effects.
      CONCLUSION: Transhepatic arterial perfusion of warmed lipiodol (80 degrees C) and
      chemotherapeutic agents (50 degrees C), namely, "dual-thermotherapy" is a simple,
      safe and effective method for treating hepatic carcinoma with less complications 
      than ordinary TACE.

TI  - Monolayer HNb3O8 for selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzylic alcohols with
      visible light response.
PG  - 2951-5
LID - 10.1002/anie.201311280 [doi]
AB  - Monolayer HNb3O8 2D nanosheets have been used as highly chemoselective and active
      photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of alcohols. The nanosheets exhibit
      improved photocatalytic activity over their layered counterparts. Results of in
      situ FTIR, DRS, ESR, and DFT calculations show the formation of surface complexes
      between the Lewis acid sites on HNb3O8 2D nanosheets and alcohols. These
      complexes play a key role in the photocatalytic activity of the material.
      Furthermore, the unique structural features of the nanosheets contributed to
      their high photocatalytic activity. An electron transition from the coordinated
      alcohol species to surface Nb atoms takes place and initiates the aerobic
      oxidation of alcohols with high product selectivity under visible light
      irradiation. This reaction process is distinct from that of classic semiconductor
      photocatalysis.

TI  - Expression of dynein, cytoplasmic 2, heavy chain 1 (DHC2) associated with
      glioblastoma cell resistance to temozolomide.
PG  - 28948
LID - 10.1038/srep28948 [doi]
AB  - Temozolomide (TMZ) is the main chemotherapeutic drug utilized for the treatment
      of glioblastoma multiforme (GMB), however, drug resistance often leads to tumor
      recurrence and poor outcomes. GMB cell lines were treated with TMZ for up to two 
      weeks and then subjected to proteomics analysis to identify the underlying
      molecular pathology that is associated with TMZ resistance. Proteomics data
      showed that TMZ altered expression of proteins that related to cytoskeleton
      structure and function, such as DHC2 and KIF2B. qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence
      were used to verify expression of DHC2 and KIF2B in these cells.
      Immunohistochemistry was used to verify expression of these two proteins in
      xenografts of a nude mouse model, and ex vivo GBM tissue samples. Their
      expression was knocked down using siRNA to confirm their role in the regulation
      of GBM cell sensitivity to TMZ. Knockdown of DHC2 expression enhanced sensitivity
      of U87 cells to TMZ treatment. Ex vivo data showed that DHC2 expression in GBM
      tissue samples was associated with tumor recurrence after TMZ chemotherapy. These
      results indicated cytoskeleton related protein DHC2 reduced sensitivity of GBM
      cells to TMZ treatment. Further studies should assess DHC2 as a novel target in
      GBM for TMZ combination treatment.

PG  - 4745-7
LID - 10.1021/bi400801q [doi]
AB  - U1A binds U1hpII, a hairpin RNA with a 10-nucleotide loop. A U1A mutant
      (DeltaK50DeltaM51) binds U1hpII-derived hairpins with shorter loops, making it an
      interesting scaffold for engineering or evolving proteins that bind similarly
      sized disease-related hairpin RNAs. However, a more detailed understanding of
      complexes involving DeltaK50DeltaM51 is likely a prerequisite to generating such 
      proteins. Toward this end, we measured mutational effects for complexes involving
      U1A DeltaK50DeltaM51 and U1hpII-derived hairpin RNAs with seven- or
      eight-nucleotide loops and identified contacts that are critical to the
      stabilization of these complexes. Our data provide valuable insight into
      sequence-selective recognition of seven- or eight-nucleotide loop hairpins by an 
      engineered RNA binding protein.

TI  - Monitoring Training Loads: The Past, the Present, and the Future.
PG  - S22-S28
LID - 10.1123/ijspp.2016-0388 [doi]
AB  - Training monitoring is about keeping track of what athletes accomplish in
      training, for the purpose of improving the interaction between coach and athlete.
      Over history there have been several basic schemes of training monitoring. In the
      earliest days training monitoring was about observing the athlete during standard
      workouts. However, difficulty in standardizing the conditions of training made
      this process unreliable. With the advent of interval training, monitoring became 
      more systematic. However, imprecision in the measurement of heart rate (HR)
      evolved interval training toward index workouts, where the main monitored
      parameter was average time required to complete index workouts. These measures of
      training load focused on the external training load, what the athlete could
      actually do. With the advent of interest from the scientific community, the
      development of the concept of metabolic thresholds and the possibility of
      trackside measurement of HR, lactate, VO2, and power output, there was greater
      interest in the internal training load, allowing better titration of training
      loads in athletes of differing ability. These methods show much promise but often
      require laboratory testing for calibration and tend to produce too much
      information, in too slow a time frame, to be optimally useful to coaches. The
      advent of the TRIMP concept by Banister suggested a strategy to combine intensity
      and duration elements of training into a single index concept, training load.
      Although the original TRIMP concept was mathematically complex, the development
      of the session RPE and similar low-tech methods has demonstrated a way to
      evaluate training load, along with derived variables, in a simple, responsive
      way. Recently, there has been interest in using wearable sensors to provide
      high-resolution data of the external training load. These methods are promising, 
      but problems relative to information overload and turnaround time to coaches
      remain to be solved.

PG  - 80-8

AB  - Recent studies suggest that multisensory integration does not only occur in
      higher association cortices but also at early stages of auditory processing,
      possibly in primary or secondary auditory cortex. Support for such early
      multisensory influences comes from functional magnetic resonance imaging
      experiments in humans and monkeys. However we argue that the current
      understanding of neurovascular coupling and of the neuronal basis underlying the 
      imaging signal does not permit the direct extrapolation from imaging data to
      properties of neurons in the same region. While imaging can guide subsequent
      electrophysiological studies, only these can determine whether and how neurons in
      auditory cortices combine information from multiple modalities. Indeed,
      electrophysiological studies only partly confirm the findings from imaging
      studies. While recordings of field potentials reveal strong influences of visual 
      or somatosensory stimulation on synaptic activity even in primary auditory
      cortex, single unit studies find only a small minority of neurons as being
      influenced by non-acoustic stimuli. We propose the analysis of the information
      coding properties of individual neurons as one way to quantitatively determine
      whether the representation of our acoustic environment in (primary) auditory
      cortex indeed benefits from multisensory input.

AB  - In this review, we briefly described microRNA biogenesis, function and the
      principal approaches for studying the function of microRNAs (miRNA) in solid
      cancers. There are currently hundreds of confirmed miRNAs in humans, and
      computational predictions suggest that the total count might be more than
      thousand. The regulatory nature of miRNAs combined with the large number of
      presumptive target genes suggests that they are essential regulators of a wide
      range of cellular processes. To illustrate the importance of miRNA-mediated
      regulation in solid cancer some confirmed interactions were collected. Their
      relevance is described in detail in melanomas from the aspect of diagnosis, the
      potential application of miRNAs as biomarkers and as potential therapeutic tools.

TI  - Effect of Maintenance Therapy with Isoxsuprine in the Prevention of Preterm
      Labor: Randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1144-9
LID - 10.14661/2015.1144-1149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isoxsuprine (Vasodilan) is a beta-adrenergic that directly affects
      the vascular smooth muscle and results in peripheral vascular dilation.
      Isoxsuprine relaxes the uterine smooth muscles and is used for treatment of
      pre-term labor and dysmenorrhea. Isoxsuprine is used extensively in hospitals and
      private clinics in Iran; however, few studies have reported its safety and
      efficacy in the prevention of pre-term labor. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
      was to assess the effect of maintenance therapy with oral isoxsuprine for the
      prevention of pre-term labor. METHODS: We undertook a blinded prospective
      randomized trial of 70 women with singleton pregnancies who presented in pre-term
      labor between 26 to 34 weeks of gestation. After arresting the contractions with 
      intravenous magnesium sulfate, the patients were randomized into two groups, with
      the treatment group receiving oral isoxsuprine until 34 weeks of gestation.
      Response to treatment was assessed by the progression of the pregnancies in both 
      groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Our results showed
      that 14 (40%) of the patients in the case group and 12 (34.29%) of patients in
      the control group had pre-term births, and there was no significant difference
      between the two groups (P=0.621). Also four women (11.43%) in the case group and 
      five women (14.29%) in the control group delivered before 34 weeks (P=0.721).
      CONCLUSION: Oral isoxsuprine was not effective as a maintenance treatment in
      preventing pre-term births or in delaying delivery until after 34 weeks. Larger
      studies are needed to identify the best treatment for pre-term labor.

AB  - Several biogeographic barriers in the Central African highlands have reduced gene
      flow among populations of many terrestrial species in predictable ways. Yet, a
      comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying species divergence in the
      Afrotropics can be obscured by unrecognized levels of cryptic diversity,
      particularly in widespread species. We implemented a multilocus phylogeographic
      approach to examine diversity within the widely distributed Central African pygmy
      chameleon, Rhampholeon boulengeri. Gene-tree analyses coupled with a comparative 
      coalescent-based species delimitation framework revealed R. boulengeri as a
      complex of at least six genetically distinct species. The spatiotemporal
      speciation patterns for these cryptic species conform to general biogeographic
      hypotheses supporting vicariance as the main factor behind patterns of divergence
      in the Albertine Rift, a biodiversity hotspot in Central Africa. However, we
      found that parapatric species and sister species inhabited adjacent habitats, but
      were found in largely non-overlapping elevational ranges in the Albertine Rift,
      suggesting that differentiation in elevation was also an important mode of
      divergence. The phylogeographic patterns recovered for the genus-level phylogeny 
      provide additional evidence for speciation by isolation in forest refugia, and
      dating estimates indicated that the Miocene was a significant period for this
      diversification. Our results highlight the importance of investigating cryptic
      diversity in widespread species to improve understanding of diversification
      patterns in environmentally diverse regions such as the montane Afrotropics.

AB  - In this investigation, we evaluated the naturally acquired immune response to
      Plasmodium vivax stage-specific antigens in individuals of different age groups
      belonging to malaria endemic areas of northern India. Four synthetic peptides
      containing both B- and T-cell epitopes from P. vivax circumsporozoite protein,
      merozoite surface protein-1, apical membrane antigen-1 and gametocyte surface
      antigen-1 were used to determine both humoral and cellular immune responses.
      Immunity, in terms of antibody response and T-cell proliferation against these
      stage-specific peptides, has been observed in the study subjects. The results
      demonstrated age-dependent antibody response in this population. Forty two
      patients were diagnosed with P. vivax. There was a significant association
      (P=0.013) between number of antibody responders and recognition of stage-specific
      epitopes by antibodies. The antibody response to B-epitopes of P. vivax CSP,
      MSP1, AMA1 and GAM1 was associated with age; adults responded more frequently to 
      these antigens than did younger children. In this population, 66% (201/304) cases
      showed seropositivity to all peptides and 13% (41/304) showed negative response. 
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of more than 75% of individuals proliferated
      in response to stimulation by all four epitopes. In conclusion, the results
      demonstrated immunogenicity of the epitopes to P. vivax in population of this
      endemic zone.

      and particularly in marine bacterioplankton representatives. Expression of GTA
      genes and extracellular release of GTA particles ( approximately 50 to 70 nm) was
      demonstrated experimentally for the Roseobacter clade member Silicibacter
      pomeroyi DSS-3, and intraspecific gene transfer was documented. GTA homologs are 
      surprisingly infrequent in marine metagenomic sequence data, however, and the
      role of this lateral gene transfer mechanism in ocean bacterioplankton
      communities remains unclear.

AB  - Synthesis of novel pyranochromanone amide hybrids, by combining pyranochromanone 
      pharmacophore and privileged scaffolds such as
      2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiaole/2-aminothiazole/aminopyridine/aminonaphthalene and
      anti-cancer evaluation of a series led us to discover a series of new chemical
      entities (NCEs) showing broad spectrum of anti-cancer activity against three
      different human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, A549 and HeLa), at IC50 values ranging 
      from 14.3 to 97.8 muM. Among them, some compounds such as 15b, 15d, 20a and 20b
      displayed excellent activity against breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Detailed
      biological studies such as AO/EB dual staining, Hoechst 33342 staining, FACS
      analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) using JC-1 dye and DNA
      fragmentation confirmed the apoptosis induced by the hybrids. Gene expression
      studies by Real time RT-PCR has shown that these compounds are efficient
      regulator of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. Western blot analysis also revealed that 
      these compounds persuade apoptosis through intrinsic pathway by up-regulating the
      pro-apoptotic protein Bax and down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.
      Molecular docking studies reveal that compounds 15b and 20b binds efficiently
      with Bcl-2 promoter G-quadruplex.

AB  - This article reviews the literature on normal and impaired spelling development
      in English. Once children begin to learn that the function of alphabetic writing 
      is to represent the sounds of language, they go through the process of learning
      sound-spelling correspondences in increasingly fine detail. Continued experience 
      with print allows children to learn about orthographic and morphological
      conventions of the language. Within this general framework, the authors describe 
      research that underscores the importance of fine-grained linguistic analyses of
      spelling performance. It is concluded that such an approach holds a great deal of
      promise for theory and practice.

TI  - Trends in health care expenditures, utilization, and health status among US
      adults with spine problems, 1997-2006.
PG  - 2077-84
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181b1fad1 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of nationally representative survey data for spine-related
      health care expenditures, utilization and self-reported health status. OBJECTIVE:
      To study trends from 1997 to 2006 in per-user expenditures for spine-related
      inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and emergency services; and to compare these
      trends to changes in health status. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although prior
      work has shown overall spine-related expenditures accounted for $86 billion in
      2005, increasing 65% since 1997, the study did not report per-user expenditures. 
      Understanding population-level per-user expenditure for specific services
      relative to changes in the health status may help assess the value of these
      services. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a 
      multistage survey sample designed to produce unbiased national estimates of
      health care utilization and expenditure. Spine-related hospitalizations,
      outpatient visits, prescription medications and emergency department visits were 
      identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. Regression analyses controlling for
      age, sex, comorbidity, and time (years) were used to examine trends from 1997 to 
      2006 in inflation-adjusted per-user expenditures, and utilization, and
      self-reported health status. RESULTS: An average of 1774 respondents with spine
      problems was surveyed per year; the proportion suggested an increase in the
      number of people who sought treatment for spine problems in the United States
      from 14.8 million in 1997 to 21.9 million in 2006. From 1997 to 2006, the mean
      adjusted per-user expenditures were the largest component of increasing total
      costs for inpatient hospitalizations, prescription medications, andemergency
      department visits, increasing 37% (from $13,040 in 1997 to $17,909 in 2006), 139%
      (from $166 to $397), and 84% (from $81 to $149), respectively. A 49% increase in 
      the number of patients seeking spine-related care (from 12.2 million in 1997 to
      18.2 million in 2006) was the largest contributing factor to increased outpatient
      expenditures. Population measures of mental health and work, social, and physical
      limitations worsened over time among people with spine problems. CONCLUSION:
      Expenditure increases for spine-related inpatient, prescription, and emergency
      services were primarily the result of increasing per-user expenditures, while
      those related to outpatient visits were primarily due to an increase in the
      number of users of ambulatory services.

TI  - Transition from ziprasidone im to oral formulation in agitated patients with
      acute exacerbation of schizophrenia: an open trial.
PG  - 173-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1280794 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A transition from IM to oral formulation of an antipsychotic agent 
      is often required during the long-term management of schizophrenia. This
      multicenter trial evaluates the IM/oral sequential administration of ziprasidone 
      in agitated subjects with an exacerbation of schizophrenia. METHODS: Adult
      patients requiring IM therapy for schizophrenic symptoms were assigned to IM
      ziprasidone 10 mg for 3 days, followed by oral ziprasidone (initial dose: 80
      mg/day) for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy outcomes were the change in the total
      PANSS and in the CGI-S scores vs. baseline values. RESULTS: In total, 150
      patients were included in the study. A decline in the PANSS and CGI-S scores was 
      observed throughout the study (p < 0.0001 vs. baseline): these reductions became 
      significant at the point of transition from IM to oral formulation (p < 0.0001
      vs. baseline). DISCUSSION: Even with the limitations of any non-comparative
      study, these results suggest that the IM/oral sequential administration of
      ziprasidone is an effective and well tolerated therapeutic option in the
      management of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia in agitated patients.

TI  - Differential metabolism of gefitinib and erlotinib by human cytochrome P450
      enzymes.
PG  - 3731-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the enzyme kinetics of gefitinib and erlotinib metabolism by 
      individual cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and to compare their effects on CYP3A
      activity, with the aim to better understand mechanisms underlying pharmacokinetic
      variability and clinical effects. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Enzyme kinetics were
      examined by incubating gefitinib or erlotinib (1.5-50 micromol/L) with
      recombinant human CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 (10-160
      pmol/mL). Their effects on CYP3A activity were examined by comparing midazolam
      metabolism in the presence and absence of gefitinib or erlotinib in human liver
      and intestinal microsomes. Parent compounds and metabolites were monitored by
      high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode detector or tandem mass 
      spectrometer. RESULTS: Both drugs were metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, CYP3A5,
      and CYP1A1, with respective maximum clearance (Cl(max)) values for metabolism of 
      0.41, 0.39, and 0.57 mL/min/nmol for gefitinib and 0.24, 0.21, 0.31 mL/min/nmol
      for erlotinib. CYP2D6 was involved in gefitinib metabolism (Cl(max), 0.63
      mL/min/nmol) to a large extent, whereas CYP1A2 was considerably involved in
      erlotinib metabolism (Cl(max), 0.15 mL/min/nmol). Both drugs stimulated
      CYP3A-mediated midazolam disappearance and 1-hydroxymidazolam formation in liver 
      and intestinal microsomes. CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib is more susceptible to
      CYP3A-mediated metabolism than erlotinib, which may contribute to the higher
      apparent oral clearance observed for gefitinib. Metabolism by hepatic and
      extrahepatic CYP1A may represent a determinant of pharmacokinetic variability and
      response for both drugs. The differential metabolizing enzyme profiles suggest
      that there may be differences in drug-drug interaction potential and that
      stimulation of CYP3A4 may likely play a role in drug interactions for erlotinib
      and gefitinib.

TI  - [Appendicitis in childhood: correlation of clinical data with histopathological
      findings].
PG  - 449-54
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1263153 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantifying the histopathological diagnoses of appendectomies in
      daily routine paidopathology results in a high percentage of appendices without
      histomorphological sign of acute inflammation. To identify clinical factors
      significantly associated with the morphological diagnosis, histopathological
      findings and clinical data--documented in patients' files--were examined.
      PATIENTS: All 856 children (age: 5 m-15 yrs) whose appendix had been resected
      within a 7-year-period were--depending on the histopathological
      diagnoses--allocated to the group "appendix without" resp. "appendix with signs
      of acute inflammation". METHOD: All files were examined concerning anamnestic
      data, clinical signs of acute appendicitis and laboratory parameters. The data
      were analysed by chi(2)-test and Wilcoxon-test concerning differences between the
      2 groups with regard to the anamnestic and clinical facts and parameters. Using
      binary logistic regression, these clinical parameters were analyzed in
      correlation with the histopathological diagnoses. RESULTS: By consideration of
      the factors "leucocyte count", "vomiting" and "percussion tenderness" 75% of the 
      children would have been allocated to the accurate postoperative
      pathomorphological diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant correlation of
      "leucocyte count", "vomiting" and "percussion tenderness" with histopathology in 
      75% of the children. As hence 25% were not allocated correctly this combination
      is no unequivocal combination for prediction or exclusion of an acute
      appendicitis. Hence, even with these statistically significant parameters a
      comparably high percentage of falsely-positive appendectomies has to be
      anticipated.

TI  - College and university requirements for teachers of the deaf at the undergraduate
      level: a twenty-year comparison.
PG  - 322-7
AB  - College and university requirements for undergraduate deaf education teacher
      preparation programs from 1986 and 2006 were compared. Thirty percent fewer
      undergraduate programs were in existence in 2006 than in 1986. Compared to
      programs in the 1986-1987 academic year, programs in 2006-2007 placed less
      emphasis on course work related to speech and hearing and more emphasis on the
      development of sign language skills. These findings are discussed in relation to 
      the increasing probability that future employment for program graduates will be
      in itinerant and resource placements within public schools with children whose
      hearing losses are less severe than those of children in the past.

TI  - Advances in supportive care for multiple myeloma.
PG  - 502-11
AB  - As patients with multiple myeloma live longer, helping them live better through
      improvements in supportive care is equally as vital. Intrinsic to the disease are
      bone-related complications at presentation and over the course of illness.
      Bisphosphonates have been an important therapy for ameliorating the risk of
      skeletal-related events, and work is ongoing to determine their optimal schedule.
      Patients with multiple myeloma also encounter several challenges related to their
      treatment, including peripheral neuropathy, thrombotic complications, and
      infections. These challenges are being addressed through a better understanding
      of the risk factors for developing these complications and by mitigating these
      risks through better dosing schemas and prophylaxis.

TI  - Can a curved stapler made for open surgery be useful in laparoscopic lower rectal
      resections? Technique and experience of a single centre.
PG  - S23-6
LID - 10.1016/j.surge.2012.10.001 [doi]
LID - S1479-666X(12)00101-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of laparoscopy to perform lower anterior rectal resection is 
      increasing worldwide because it allows better visualisation and rectal
      mobilisation and also reduces postoperative pain and recovery. The Contour Curved
      Stapler (CCS) is a very helpful device because of its curved profile that enables
      better access into the pelvic cavity and allows rectal closure and section to be 
      performed in one shot. In this paper, we present an original technique to use
      this device, made for open surgery, in laparoscopy and the results of our
      experience. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data of all patients who
      underwent lower laparoscopic anterior rectal resection and in which the CCS was
      used to perform section of the rectum between September 2005 and September 2011. 
      To perform section of the rectum a Lapdisc((R)) was inserted through a 6-7 cm
      supra-pubic midline incision to allow placement of the CCS into the pelvic
      cavity. Patients' biographical and surgical data such as sex, age, indication for
      surgery, infection, anastomotic leakage or stenosis and staple-line bleeding were
      prospectively collected in a computerised database and evaluated. RESULTS:
      Between September 2005 and September 2011, we performed 45 laparoscopic lower
      rectal resection using CCS, 27 male and 18 female with a mean age of 61 years
      (range 40-82 years) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.5 kg/m(2) (range
      16.5-35 kg/m(2)). In 29 cases a temporary ileostomy was performed. Mean operative
      time was 131 min (range 97-210 min). In all cases it was possible to perform a
      lower section of the rectum with CCS. No intraoperative or postoperative staple
      line bleeding occurred. In two patients we observed anastomotic leaks and in one 
      of these a temporary ileostomy was performed. None of the patients showed an
      anastomotic stenosis at 1-year follow-up colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      shows that CCS enables section of the lower rectum to be easily performed,
      especially in adverse anatomical condition, and the technique proposed by us
      allows the use of this stapler without giving up the benefits of laparoscopic
      access.

AB  - In the present work, we show that we obtained nanometric structures made of
      water, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol
      (Chol), and a mixture of ethoxylated and non-ethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid
      esters (Tween 20, Span 20, Tween 80, and Span 80) by mixing all of them near the 
      cloud point temperature (cp) of the ethoxylated surfactant. The influence that
      the constituents had on the size of the particle was determined by a
      pseudo-ternary phase diagram of water/Tween-Span/DPPC-Chol; the colloidal
      particles obtained were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, confocal
      fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force
      microscopy. These studies were made for all the systems with at least 23 d of
      colloidal stability. The most stable system was obtained with the Tween 80-Span
      80 pair, behaving as a typical suspension for 48 d; this system was made of
      water, Tween 80-Span 80 (80:20), DPPC-Chol (95:5) in a corresponding molar ratio 
      of 48:37:100:10. The colloidal particles obtained were a kind of emulsion and
      liposome structures. The second stable system was obtained with the same mixture,
      but in a molar ratio of 8:6:9:0, its structure was also a kind of emulsion
      particles. In both systems and in other less stable ones, the "emulsion particle"
      was completely new, it structurally corresponds to a nucleus of mixed micelles
      surrounded by at least one bilayer of DPPC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A deficit in impulse control is a prominent, heritable symptom in
      several psychiatric disorders, such as addiction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder, and schizophrenia. Here, we aimed to identify genes regulating
      impulsivity, specifically of impulsive action, in mice. METHODS: Using the widely
      used 5-choice serial reaction time task, we measured impulsive action in 1) a
      panel of 41 BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice (n = 13.7 +/- .8 per strain; n
      = 654 total) to detect underlying genetic loci; 2) congenic mice (n = 23) to
      replicate the identified locus; 3) mice overexpressing the Nrg3 candidate gene in
      the medial prefrontal cortex (n = 21); and 4) a Nrg3 loss-of-function mutant (n =
      59) to functionally implicate the Nrg3 candidate gene in impulsivity. RESULTS:
      Genetic mapping of impulsive action in the BXD panel identified a locus on
      chromosome 14 (34.5-41.4 Mb), syntenic with the human 10q22-q23
      schizophrenia-susceptibility locus. Congenic mice carrying the impulsivity locus 
      (Impu1) confirmed its influence on impulsive action. Increased impulsivity was
      associated with increased Nrg3 gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex
      (mPFC). Viral overexpression of Nrg3 in the mPFC increased impulsivity, whereas a
      constitutive Nrg3 loss-of-function mutation decreased it. CONCLUSIONS: The causal
      relation between Nrg3 expression in the mPFC and level of impulsive action shown 
      here provides a mechanism by which polymorphism in NRG3 in humans contributes to 
      a specific cognitive deficit seen in several psychiatric diseases, such as
      addiction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.

TI  - Computational Discrimination of Breast Cancer for Korean Women Based on
      Epidemiologic Data Only.
PG  - 1025-34
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2015.30.8.1025 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is the second leading cancer for Korean women and its incidence
      rate has been increasing annually. If early diagnosis were implemented with
      epidemiologic data, the women could easily assess breast cancer risk using
      internet. National Cancer Institute in the United States has released a Web-based
      Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool based on Gail model. However, it is
      inapplicable directly to Korean women since breast cancer risk is dependent on
      race. Also, it shows low accuracy (58%-59%). In this study, breast cancer
      discrimination models for Korean women are developed using only epidemiological
      case-control data (n = 4,574). The models are configured by different
      classification techniques: support vector machine, artificial neural network, and
      Bayesian network. A 1,000-time repeated random sub-sampling validation is
      performed for diverse parameter conditions, respectively. The performance is
      evaluated and compared as an area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve (AUC). According to age group and classification techniques, AUC, accuracy,
      sensitivity, specificity, and calculation time of all models were calculated and 
      compared. Although the support vector machine took the longest calculation time, 
      the highest classification performance has been achieved in the case of women
      older than 50 yr (AUC = 64%). The proposed model is dependent on demographic
      characteristics, reproductive factors, and lifestyle habits without using any
      clinical or genetic test. It is expected that the model could be implemented as a
      web-based discrimination tool for breast cancer. This tool can encourage
      potential breast cancer prone women to go the hospital for diagnostic tests.

TI  - Both host and pathogen factors predispose to Escherichia coli urinary-source
      bacteremia in hospitalized patients.
PG  - 1692-8
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The urinary tract is the most common source for Escherichia coli
      bacteremia. Mortality from E. coli urinary-source bacteremia is higher than that 
      from urinary tract infection. Predisposing factors for urinary-source E. coli
      bacteremia are poorly characterized. METHODS: In order to identify urinary-source
      bacteremia risk factors, we conducted a 12-month prospective cohort study of
      adult inpatients with E. coli bacteriuria that were tested for bacteremia within 
      +/-1 day of the bacteriuria. Patients with bacteremia were compared with those
      without bacteremia. Bacterial isolates from urine were screened for 16 putative
      virulence genes using high-throughput dot-blot hybridization. RESULTS:
      Twenty-four of 156 subjects (15%) had E. coli bacteremia. Bacteremic patients
      were more likely to have benign prostatic hyperplasia (56% vs 19%; P = .04), a
      history of urogenital surgery (63% vs 28%; P = .001), and presentation with
      hesitancy/retention (21% vs 4%; P = .002), fever (63% vs 38%; P = .02), and
      pyelonephritis (67% vs 41%; P = .02). The genes kpsMT (group II capsule) (17
      [71%] vs 62 [47%]; P = .03) and prf (P-fimbriae family) (13 [54%] vs 40 [30%]; P 
      = .02) were more frequent in the urinary strains from bacteremic patients.
      Symptoms of hesitancy/retention (odds ratio [OR], 7.8; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.6-37), history of a urogenital procedure (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2-14.7), and
      presence of kpsMT (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1-8.2) independently predicted bacteremia.
      CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia secondary to E. coli bacteriuria was frequent (15%) in
      those tested for it. Urinary stasis, surgical disruption of urogenital tissues,
      and a bacterial capsule characteristic contribute to systemic invasion by
      uropathogenic E. coli.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess potential preventability of severe acute maternal 
      morbidity (SAMM) cases admitted to intensive-care units (ICUs) or high-dependency
      units (HDUs). STUDY DESIGN: Inclusion criteria were admissions to ICUs or HDUs of
      women who were pregnant or within 42 days of delivery in 4 District Health Board 
      areas (accounting for a third of annual births in New Zealand) during a 17-month 
      period. Cases were reviewed by external multidisciplinary panels using a
      validated model for assessing preventability. RESULTS: In all, 98 SAMM cases were
      assessed; 38 (38.8%) cases were deemed potentially preventable, 36 (36.7%) not
      preventable but improvement in care was needed, and 24 (24.5%) not preventable.
      The most frequent preventable factors were clinician related: delay or failure in
      diagnosis or recognition of high-risk status (51%); and delay or inappropriate
      treatment (70%). The most common causes of preventable severe morbidity were
      blood loss and septicemia. CONCLUSION: The majority of SAMM cases were
      potentially preventable or required improvement in care. Themes around
      substandard care related to delay in diagnosis and treatment for postpartum
      hemorrhage and septicemia. These findings can inform clinical educational
      programs and policies to improve maternal outcomes. This study has now been
      expanded to a national New Zealand audit of all SAMM cases admitted to an
      ICU/HDU.

TI  - Economic evaluation of health promotion and primary prevention actions for older 
      people-a systematic review.
PG  - 670-679
LID - 10.1093/eurpub/ckx030 [doi]
AB  - Background: Healthy ageing and health promotion (HP) actions for older people
      have become an important health sector priority. At the same time, the
      application of economic evaluation methods in the field of health interventions
      in order to support allocative decision processes is of growing importance. The
      aims of the review were to analyze what the existing evidence is on
      cost-effectiveness of HP and/or primary prevention (PP) programmes for older
      people whilst providing deeper insight into methodological aspects of such
      studies, their overall quality and issues related to practical implementation of 
      results. Methods: Systematic review of contemporary evidence (2000-15). Studies' 
      eligibility criteria included target population 65 years old or older;
      interventions classified as HP or PP; a full economic evaluation conducted. The
      search strategy included five electronic databases and Internet websites of
      institutions or projects related to the topic. Quality assessment of the studies 
      was based on the 'Drummond checklist'. Results: After screening 6450 records, 29 
      papers were included, the vast majority of which (22) focus on fall prevention
      strategies. In this area, there are examples of good and moderate quality studies
      which confirm the cost-effectiveness of diverse physical activity interventions
      in fall prevention. The existing studies are characterized by huge differences in
      the methods applied as well as overall quality which limits the comparability and
      generalizability of the results. Conclusions: There is a need for development and
      implementation of economically driven studies, with methods adjusted to
      particular character of HP and/or PP strategies for older population.

      disease.
PG  - 83-7
LID - 10.1097/IOP.0b013e3181b8e614 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonic bone removal during lateral
      orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease. METHODS: Retrospective,
      comparative, interventional case series of lateral orbital decompressions
      performed by the senior author for thyroid eye disease between July 2005 and July
      2008. Patients were excluded if they had other coexisting orbital conditions or
      concurrent decompression of other orbital walls. Primary outcome measures
      included visual acuity, proptosis, lagophthalmos, eyelid retraction, and exposure
      keratopathy. RESULTS: Thirty-six consecutive lateral orbital decompressions
      performed by the senior author were reviewed. The Sonopet Omni ultrasonic
      surgical aspirator was used to remove the lateral wall in 18 cases, and a
      high-speed drill with a cutting burr was used in the other 18 cases. There was no
      significant difference between the groups in postoperative visual acuity,
      proptosis reduction, lagophthalmos, eyelid retraction, exposure keratopathy, or
      surgical complications. The average reduction in proptosis was 3.9 mm (range,
      1-6.5 mm) in the Sonopet group and 4.0 mm (range, 1-6 mm) in the drill group (p =
      0.86). In our series, the average surgical case time was slightly shorter in the 
      Sonopet group than in the drill group (104 vs. 118 minutes, p = 0.032).
      CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonic bone removal is a safe and effective alternative to
      high-speed burring during lateral orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease.

TI  - Assessment and optimization of collective variables for protein conformational
      landscape: GB1 beta-hairpin as a case study.
PG  - 094101
LID - 10.1063/1.5041073 [doi]
AB  - Collective variables (CVs), when chosen judiciously, can play an important role
      in recognizing rate-limiting processes and rare events in any biomolecular
      systems. However, high dimensionality and inherent complexities associated with
      such biochemical systems render the identification of an optimal CV a challenging
      task, which in turn precludes the elucidation of an underlying conformational
      landscape in sufficient details. In this context, a relevant model system is
      presented by a 16-residue beta-hairpin of GB1 protein. Despite being the target
      of numerous theoretical and computational studies for understanding the protein
      folding, the set of CVs optimally characterizing the conformational landscape of 
      the beta-hairpin of GB1 protein has remained elusive, resulting in a lack of
      consensus on its folding mechanism. Here we address this by proposing a pair of
      optimal CVs which can resolve the underlying free energy landscape of the GB1
      hairpin quite efficiently. Expressed as a linear combination of a number of
      traditional CVs, the optimal CV for this system is derived by employing the
      recently introduced time-structured independent component analysis approach on a 
      large number of independent unbiased simulations. By projecting the
      replica-exchange simulated trajectories along these pair of optimized CVs, the
      resulting free energy landscape of this system is able to resolve four distinct
      well-separated metastable states encompassing the extensive ensembles of folded, 
      unfolded, and molten globule states. Importantly, the optimized CVs were found to
      be capable of automatically recovering a novel partial helical state of this
      protein, without needing to explicitly invoke helicity as a constituent CV.
      Furthermore, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of each constituent in the
      optimized CV provided key insights on the relative contributions of the
      constituent CVs in the overall free energy landscapes. Finally, the kinetic
      pathways connecting these metastable states, constructed using a Markov state
      model, provide an optimum description of the underlying folding mechanism of the 
      peptide. Taken together, this work offers a quantitatively robust approach toward
      comprehensive mapping of the underlying folding landscape of a quintessential
      model system along its optimized CV.

PG  - 323-8
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318141fca1 [doi]
AB  - Gastric lesions in primary constitutive immune deficiencies include multifocal
      atrophic gastritis, erosive pangastritis, and a pattern of gastric lesions
      reminiscent of graft-versus-host disease. We describe the genetic anomalies in 2 
      monozygotic twins with an X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP; MIM 308240),
      a rare familial setting of high susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Since
      early childhood, both twin brothers exhibited a severe chronic active atrophic
      pangastritis. A germline screening of the SH2D1A (MIM 300490) and BIRC4 (MIM
      300079) genes was performed, and also a high-resolution whole-genome SNP
      profiling (Infinium Sentrix Human-1 Genotyping BeadChip, Illumina). A 3 Megabase 
      deletion in the Xq25 region, encompassing the SH2D1A gene, was defined by SNP
      array genotyping. Histologic analysis of yearly or twice yearly gastric biopsies 
      in both children showed a Helicobacter pylori-negative, Epstein-Barr
      virus-negative chronic active atrophic pangastritis, with superficial ulcer
      formation, foveolar hyperplasia, glandular dilatation and ultimately
      pseudopyloric and intestinal metaplasia. No such chronic active inflammatory
      gastric lesions have been reported to date in XLP. The similarities between XLP
      and common variable immunodeficiency (MIM 240500) underscore the need for early
      recognition and close monitoring of these gastric lesions, with special regard to
      their neoplastic potential. No infectious cause was determined. We favor a
      dysimmune mechanism in the development of this chronic atrophic gastritis,
      presenting a striking similarity to the recently described atrophic autoimmune
      pangastritis.

TI  - A metastasis biomarker (MetaSite Breast Score) is associated with distant

PG  - 42

AB  - Metastasis is the primary cause of death in early-stage breast cancer. We
      evaluated the association between a metastasis biomarker, which we call "Tumor
      Microenviroment of Metastasis" (TMEM), and risk of recurrence. TMEM are
      microanatomic structures where invasive tumor cells are in direct contact with
      endothelial cells and macrophages, and which serve as intravasation sites for
      tumor cells into the circulation. We evaluated primary tumors from 600 patients
      with Stage I-III breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in trial E2197 
      (NCT00003519), plus endocrine therapy for hormone receptor (HR)+ disease. TMEM
      were identified and enumerated using an analytically validated, fully automated
      digital pathology/image analysis method (MetaSite Breast), hereafter referred to 
      as MetaSite Score (MS). The objectives were to determine the association between 
      MS and distant relapse free interval (DRFI) and relapse free interval (RFI). MS
      was not associated with tumor size or nodal status, and correlated poorly with
      Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (r = 0.29) in 297 patients with HR+/HER2- disease.
      Proportional hazards models revealed a significant positive association between
      continuous MS and DRFI (p = 0.001) and RFI (p = 0.00006) in HR+/HER2- disease in 
      years 0-5, and by MS tertiles for DRFI (p = 0.04) and RFI (p = 0.01), but not
      after year 5 or in triple negative or HER2+ disease. Multivariate models in
      HR+/HER- disease including continuous MS, clinical covariates, and categorical
      Recurrence Score (<18, 18-30, > 30) showed MS is an independent predictor for
      5-year RFI (p = 0.05). MetaSite Score provides prognostic information for early
      recurrence complementary to clinicopathologic features and Recurrence Score.

AB  - A hospital-based, case-control study was used to describe clinical and laboratory
      findings in 83 dogs diagnosed with noninfectious, nonerosive, immune-mediated
      polyarthritis (IMPA) in western Canada. Case medical records were reviewed. Cases
      were analyzed as total IMPA cases and as subgroups [breed, systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), reactive, and idiopathic] and compared with the general
      canine hospital population. Dogs with IMPA differed in age (P = 0.004) and weight
      (P = 0.01) from other hospital admissions. Idiopathic IMPA cases were older (4-10
      y; P < 0.05), compared with the general canine hospital population, and their
      common laboratory abnormalities included the following: leukocytosis,
      nonregenerative anemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and hypoalbuminemia. The 
      SLE cases were seen more often in summer and fall (P = 0.04), raising concern of 
      an undiagnosed etiologic agent. The hock joint appeared to be the most reliable
      for diagnosis of IMPA, and arthrocentesis of both hock joints may aid in case
      identification.

PG  - 87-92
LID - 10.1016/j.heares.2008.03.004 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in GJB2 gene (encoding connexin 26) are the most common cause of
      hereditary non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSSHL) in different
      populations. The majority of GJB2 mutations are recessive, but a few dominant
      mutations have been associated with hearing loss either isolated or associated
      with skin disease. We describe a novel dominant pathogenic GJB2 mutation,
      identified in a Portuguese family affected with bilateral mild/moderate
      high-frequency NSSHL. In vitro functional studies demonstrate that the mutant
      protein (p.M163L) has defective trafficking to the plasma membrane and is
      associated with increased cell death.

AB  - The current study reports rapid and easy method for synthesis of eco-friendly
      silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Coriandrum sativum leaves extract as a
      reducing and covering agent. The bio-reductive synthesis of AgNPs was monitored
      using a scanning double beam UV-vis spectrophotometer. Transmission electron
      microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the morphology of AgNPs obtained from
      plant extracts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of AgNPs indicate that the
      structure of AgNPs is the face centered cubic structure of metallic silver. The
      surface morphology and topography of the AgNPs were examined by scanning electron
      microscopy and the energy dispersive spectrum revealed the presence of elemental 
      silver in the sample. The silver phyto nanoparticles were collected from plant
      extract and tested growth potential and metabolic pattern in (Lupinus termis L.) 
      seedlings upon exposure to different concentrations of AgNPs. The seedlings were 
      exposed to various concentrations of (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mg L(-1)) AgNPs for ten
      days. Significant reduction in shoot and root elongation, shoot and root fresh
      weights, total chlorophyll and total protein contents were observed under the
      higher concentrations of AgNPs. Exposure to 0.5 mg L(-1) of AgNPs decreased sugar
      contents and caused significant foliar proline accumulation which considered as
      an indicator of the stressful effect of AgNPs on seedlings. AgNPs exposure
      resulted in a dose dependent decrease in different growth parameters and also
      caused metabolic disorders as evidenced by decreased carbohydrates and protein
      contents. Further studies needed to find out the efficacy, longevity and toxicity
      of AgNPs toward photosynthetic system and antioxidant parameters to improve the
      current investigation.

TI  - The fractal city theory revisited: new empirical evidence from the distribution
      of Romanian cities and towns.
PG  - 15-28
AB  - Some of the main ideas of the fractal city theory are briefly reviewed, and their
      applicability is tested for the medium and small-size Romanian urban settlements.
      The universality of Zipf law for cities and towns distribution is proved once
      again and a stochastic master equation is proposed in order to explain the
      empirical distribution. The urban structure of Bucharest is investigated as an
      example of medium-size city formed by merging some independent poles of growth.
      The Central Places Theory is found to be in disagreement with the real urban
      structure. Instead, the diffusion-limited aggregation and self-organized
      criticality mechanisms are investigated by means of some numerical simulations
      and are found to fit better the urban perimeter growth.

TI  - Regulatory Effect of Iguratimod on the Balance of Th Subsets and Inhibition of
      Inflammatory Cytokines in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
PG  - 356040
LID - 10.1155/2015/356040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To expand upon the role of iguratimod (T-614) in the treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we investigated whether the Th1, Th17, follicular
      helper T cells (Tfh), and regulatory T cells (Treg) imbalance could be reversed
      by iguratimod and the clinical implications of this reversal. METHODS: In this
      trial, 74 patients were randomized into iguratimod-treated (group A) and control 
      (broup B) group for a 24-week treatment period. In the subsequent 28 weeks, both 
      groups were given iguratimod. Frequencies of Th1, Th17, Tfh, and Treg were
      quantified using flow cytometry, and serum cytokines were detected by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mRNA expression of cytokines and
      transcriptional factor were quantified by RT-PCR. The composite Disease Activity 
      Score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were assessed at
      each visit. RESULT: The clinical scores demonstrated effective suppression of
      disease after treatment with iguratimod. In addition, iguratimod downregulated
      Th1, Th17-type response and upregulated Treg. Furthermore, the levels of Th1,
      Th17, and Tfh associated inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors were
      reduced after treatment with iguratimod, while the levels of Treg associated
      cytokines and transcription factors were increased.

AB  - PURPOSE:: To assess antioxidant effects of acai seed extract on anorexia-cachexia
      induced by Walker-256 tumor. METHODS:: A population of 20 lab rats were
      distributed into four groups (n=5): Control Group (CG), which only received tumor
      inoculation. Experimental Group-100 (EG-100), with animals submitted to tumor
      inoculation and treated with seed extract in a 100 mg / ml concentration through 
      gavage. Experimental Group-200 (EG-200), with animals submitted to tumor
      inoculation and treated with seed extract in a 200 mg / ml concentration. Placebo
      Group (GP), which received tumor inoculation and ethanol-water solution. We
      analyzed proteolysis, lipid peroxidation, tumor diameter and weight. RESULTS::
      Lipid peroxidation was representative only in the cerebral cortex, where there
      was more oxidative stress in rats treated with the extract (p = 0.0276). For
      proteolysis, there was less muscle damage in untreated rats (p = 0.0312). Only
      tumor diameter in treated rats was significantly lower (p = 0.0200) compared to
      untreated ones. CONCLUSIONS:: The acai seed extract showed no beneficial effect
      on the general framework of the cachectic syndrome in lab rats. However, some
      anticarcinogenic effects were observed in the tumor diameter and weight.

      chemiluminescence.
PG  - 597-605
LID - 10.1021/ac071545f [doi]
AB  - Recent gene expression studies at the single bacterial cell level have primarily 
      used green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the reporter. However, fluorescence
      monitoring has intrinsic limitations, such as GFP maturation time, high
      background, and photobleaching. To overcome those problems, we introduce the
      alternative approach of chemiluminescence (CL) detection with firefly luciferase 
      as the probe. Firefly luciferase is roughly 100 times more efficient and is
      faster in generating CL than bacterial luciferase but requires the introduction
      of luciferin, a species that is not native to bacteria. The difficulty of
      luciferin diffusion into the cells was solved by making use of cell membrane
      leakage during bacteria dehydration. In this scheme, the overall sensitivity of
      the system approaches the single protein molecule level. Quantitative studies of 
      gene expression in BL21 and XLU102 bacteria can thus be performed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lexatumumab (HGS-ETR2) is a fully human agonistic mAb to the tumor
      necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 that activates the
      extrinsic apoptosis pathway and has potent preclinical antitumor activity.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phase 1, dose escalation study assessed the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs) and immunogenicity of lexatumumab
      administered i.v. every 14 days in patients with advanced solid tumors. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-one patients received lexatumumab over five dose levels (0.1-10 mg/kg).
      Most (26 of 31) received four or more cycles of treatment. One patient at 10
      mg/kg experienced a possibly related dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3
      hyperamylasemia. Nine patients achieved stable disease. One patient with
      chemotherapy-refractive Hodgkin's disease experienced a mixed response.
      Lexatumumab PKs were linear up to 10 mg/kg. At the 10 mg/kg dose, the mean
      (+/-standard deviation) t(1/2b) was 13.67 +/- 4.07 days, clearance was 4.95 +/-
      1.93 ml/day/kg, V(1) was 45.55 ml/kg and V(ss) was 79.08 ml/kg, indicating that
      lexatumumab distributes outside the plasma compartment. No human antihuman
      antibodies were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Lexatumumab can be safely administered
      every 14 days at 10 mg/kg. The PK profile supports this schedule. Further
      evaluation of lexatumumab at this dose schedule is warranted, including
      combination trials with other agents.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Residency applicants often use social media to discuss the positive
      and negative features of prospective training programs. An examination of the
      content discussed by applicants could provide guidance for how a medical
      education faculty can better engage with prospective trainees and adapt to meet
      the educational expectations of a new generation of digital-native physicians.
      OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify unstructured social media data submitted
      by residency applicants and categorize positive and negative statements to
      determine key themes. DESIGN: The study design was qualitative analysis of a
      retrospective cohort. SETTING: Publicly available datasets were used.
      PARTICIPANTS: The participants were anonymized medical trainees applying to
      residency training positions in 9 specialties-dermatology, general surgery,
      internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, plastic surgery, otolaryngology,
      physical medicine and rehabilitation, pediatrics, and radiology-from 2007 to
      2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: After we developed a standardized coding scheme
      that broke comments down into major features, themes, and subthemes, all
      unstructured comments were coded by two independent researchers. Positive and
      negative comments were coded separately. Frequency counts and percentages were
      recorded for each identified feature, theme, and subtheme. The percent positive
      and negative comments by specialty were also calculated. RESULTS: Of the 6314
      comments identified, 4541 were positive and 1773 were negative. Institution was
      the most commonly cited major feature in both the positive (n=767 [17%]) and
      negative (n=827 [47%]) comments. Geography was the most cited theme, and City,
      Cost of Living, and Commute were commonly cited subthemes. Training was the next 
      most cited major feature in both positive (n=1005 [22%]) and negative (n=291
      [16%]) comments, with Clinical Training being more commonly cited compared to
      Research Opportunities. Overall, 72% of comments from all were positive; however,
      the percent of comments that were positive comments varied significantly across
      the 9 specialties. Pediatrics (65%), dermatology (66%), and internal medicine
      (68%) applicants were more likely to express negative comments compared with the 
      global average, but physical medicine and rehabilitation (85%), radiology (82%), 
      otolaryngology (81%), and plastic surgery (80%) applicants were more likely to
      express positive comments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This qualitative analysis
      of positive and negative themes as posted by applicants in recent matching years 
      is the first and provides new detailed insights into the motivations and desires 
      of trainees.

AB  - Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is associated with
      significant recanalisation failure in the setting of large artery occlusion.
      Endovascular treatment by stentriever achieves improved rates of recanalisation
      but its impact on clinical outcomes remains unclear. We hypothesise that
      successful recanalisation, unattentuated by age and stroke severity, is
      associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients treated with the Solitaire
      stentriever (ev3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA). We conducted a retrospective
      study of 60 consecutive acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with the
      Solitaire stentriever. The data included demographics, vascular risk factors,
      ictal onset time, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at
      presentation, angiographic findings, post-procedure imaging, and clinical
      follow-up. Recanalisation success was defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral
      infarction score (TICI) >/= 2b. Good clinical outcome was defined as a modified
      Rankin Scale score (mRS) </= 2 at 3 months. Of the 60 patients, the mean age was 
      64.1 (standard deviation 13.4) years and 68.3% were men. Median NIHSS score at
      presentation was 18 (interquartile range 14-22). Successful recanalisation (TICI 
      >/= 2b) was achieved in 44 patients (73.3%). Of these 44 patients, 25 patients
      (56.8%) achieved mRS </= 2 at 3months. Multiple logistic regression showed
      significant association between recanalisation success and improved clinical
      outcome (p=0.019). Of all patients, four (6.7%) developed symptomatic
      intracranial haemorrhage. Overall mortality was 28.3%. In conclusion, the
      Solitaire stentriever was associated with improved recanalisation rates. We
      showed that successful recanalisation is associated with good clinical outcomes
      after adjustments for age, sex and stroke severity.

PG  - 194
LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-15-194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of reduction and screw perforation causes high failure rates in 
      the treatment of proximal humerus fractures. The purpose of the present study was
      to evaluate the early postoperative complications using modern Dynamic Locking
      Screws (DLS 3.7) for plating of proximal humerus fractures. METHODS: Between
      03/2009 and 12/2010, 64 patients with acute proximal humerus fractures were
      treated by angular stable plate fixation using DLSs in a limited multi-centre
      study. Follow-up examinations were performed three, six, twelve and twenty-four
      weeks postoperatively and any complications were carefully collected. RESULTS: 56
      of 64 patients were examined at the six-month follow-up. Complications were
      observed in 12 patients (22%). In five cases (9%), a perforation of the DLS 3.7
      occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of modern DLS 3.7, the early complications
      after plating of proximal humerus fractures remain high. The potential advantage 
      of the DLS 3.7 regarding secondary screw perforation has to be confirmed by
      future randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Lung cancer in never smokers in the UK Million Women Study.
PG  - 347-54
LID - 10.1002/ijc.30084 [doi]
AB  - To assess directly the effects of various risk factors on lung cancer incidence
      among never smokers, large prospective studies are needed. In a cohort of 1.2
      million UK women without prior cancer, half (634,039) reported that they had
      never smoked. Mean age at recruitment was 55 (SD5) years, and during 14 (SD3)
      years of follow-up, 0.2% (1,469) of these never smokers developed lung cancer.
      Cox regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) of lung cancer for 34
      potential risk factors, of which 31 were nonsignificant (p > 0.05). The remaining
      three risk factors were associated with a significantly increased incidence of
      lung cancer in never smokers: non-white vs. white ethnicity (RR = 2.34, 95% CI
      1.55-3.52, p < 0.001), asthma requiring treatment vs. not (RR = 1.32, 1.10-1.58, 
      p = 0.003) and taller stature (height >/= 165 cm vs. <160 cm: RR = 1.16,
      1.03-1.32, p = 0.02). There was little association with other sociodemographic,
      anthropometric or hormonal factors, or with dietary intakes of meat, fish, fruit,
      vegetables and fiber. The findings were not materially affected by restricting
      the analyses to adenocarcinomas, the most common histological type among never
      smokers.

TI  - Postoperative care in endoscopic sinus surgery: a critical review.
PG  - 35-42
LID - 10.1097/MOO.0000000000000332 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps is a
      common disease affecting people all over the world. Functional endoscopic sinus
      surgery (FESS) has become the gold standard treatment for medically refractive
      disease. Postoperative care is recommended by international leaders as an
      important part of the patient's management. This article is a critical review and
      discussion focusing on postoperative care, which is based on expert opinion,
      clinical studies, randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis studies. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Postoperative care including nasal rinsing, topical corticosteroids,
      antibiotics and avoidance of nasal packing are unanimously considered to be the
      cornerstone of best practice following FESS. However, the effectiveness of
      in-office nasal debridement is still under debate. SUMMARY: There is a lack of
      consensus regarding the necessity of performing in-office nasal debridement and
      the majority of clinicians carry out their postoperative care according to
      experience and their own preference. This is often determined by the extent of
      surgery performed, the severity of the postoperative inflammation, as well as
      being dependent on the patient's discomfort, the time constraints associated with
      postoperative care and the costs associated with additional appointments.
      Ideally, nasal debridement should be performed by the operating surgeon under
      endoscopic control both gently and atraumatically.

TI  - The role of an MMP inhibitor in the regulation of mechanical tension by
      Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts.
PG  - 783-7
LID - 10.1177/1753193409345188 [doi]
AB  - Mechanical tension and contracture are two related facets of tissue biology. This
      study assessed the effect of ilomastat, a broad-spectrum matrix metalloprotease
      (MMP) inhibitor, on generation of tension by Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts.
      Nodule and cord-derived fibroblasts were isolated from five patients with
      Dupuytren's disease; flexor retinaculum acted as the control. A culture force
      monitor (CFM) provided an in vitro model of tissue organization to assess
      development of mechanical tension, lattice contraction and spatial remodelling by
      fibroblasts. Responses to ilomastat were compared to treatment with a control
      peptide. Nodule and cord-derived fibroblasts exhibited a two-fold increase in
      tension compared with flexor retinaculum. Ilomastat significantly inhibited
      development of tension by nodule and cord but not flexor retinaculum derived
      fibroblasts at 100 microM. These results imply that MMP activity mediates
      regulation of tensile strength by Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts and may be an
      important therapeutic target in patients with Dupuytren's disease.

      near-infrared spectroscopy.
PG  - 516
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00516 [doi]
AB  - In recent decades, a lot of achievements have been obtained in imaging and
      cognitive neuroscience of human brain. Brain's activities can be shown by a
      number of different kinds of non-invasive technologies, such as: Near-Infrared
      Spectroscopy (NIRS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and ElectroEncephaloGraphy
      (EEG; Wolpaw et al., 2002; Weiskopf et al., 2004; Blankertz et al., 2006). NIRS
      has become the convenient technology for experimental brain purposes. The change 
      of oxygenation changes (oxy-Hb) along task period depending on location of
      channel on the cortex has been studied: sustained activation in the motor cortex,
      transient activation during the initial segments in the somatosensory cortex, and
      accumulating activation in the frontal lobe (Gentili et al., 2010). Oxy-Hb
      concentration at the aforementioned sites in the brain can also be used as a
      predictive factor allows prediction of subject's investigation behavior with a
      considerable degree of precision (Shimokawa et al., 2009). In this paper, a study
      of recognition algorithm will be described for recognition whether one taps the
      left hand (LH) or the right hand (RH). Data with noises and artifacts collected
      from a multi-channel system will be pre-processed using a Savitzky-Golay filter
      for getting more smoothly data. Characteristics of the filtered signals during LH
      and RH tapping process will be extracted using a polynomial regression (PR)
      algorithm. Coefficients of the polynomial, which correspond to Oxygen-Hemoglobin 
      (Oxy-Hb) concentration, will be applied for the recognition models of hand
      tapping. Support Vector Machines (SVM) will be applied to validate the obtained
      coefficient data for hand tapping recognition. In addition, for the objective of 
      comparison, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) was also applied to recognize hand 
      tapping side with the same principle. Experimental results have been done many
      trials on three subjects to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - In vivo cellular adaptation to ER stress: survival strategies with double-edged
      consequences.
PG  - 2145-54
LID - 10.1242/jcs.068833 [doi]
AB  - Disturbances to the balance of protein synthesis, folding and secretion in the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induce stress and thereby the ER stress signaling
      (ERSS) response, which alleviates this stress. In this Commentary, we review the 
      emerging idea that ER stress caused by abnormal physiological conditions and/or
      mutations in genes that encode client proteins of the ER is a key factor
      underlying different developmental processes and the pathology of diverse
      diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration and skeletal dysplasias. Recent
      studies in mouse models indicate that the effect of ERSS in vivo and the nature
      of the cellular strategies induced to ameliorate pathological ER stress are
      crucial factors in determining cell fate and clinical disease features.
      Importantly, ERSS can affect cellular proliferation and the differentiation
      program; cells that survive the stress can become 'reprogrammed' or
      dysfunctional. These cell-autonomous adaptation strategies can generate a
      spectrum of context-dependent cellular consequences, ranging from recovery to
      death. Secondary effects can include altered cell-extracellular-matrix
      interactions and non-cell-autonomous alteration of paracrine signaling, which
      contribute to the final phenotypic outcome. Recent reports showing that ER stress
      can be alleviated by chemical compounds suggest the potential for novel
      therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Small vessel remodeling and impaired endothelial-dependent dilatation in
      subcutaneous resistance arteries from patients with acromegaly.
PG  - 1111-7
LID - 10.1210/jc.2008-0948 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Patients with acromegaly have increased morbidity and mortality,
      predominantly from cardiovascular disease. Hypertension and diabetes are more
      prevalent, and both cause small vessel remodeling and endothelial dysfunction.
      OBJECTIVE: To understand the structure and function of small arteries in
      acromegaly, sc blood vessels from gluteal fat biopsies were harvested from 18
      patients with active disease (AD; age, 56 +/- 15 yr; 14 males), 23 patients in
      remission (CD; age, 55 +/- 12 yr; 15 males), and 20 healthy controls (age, 55 +/-
      11 yr; 10 males) and examined in vitro using pressure myography. DESIGN:
      Contractile responses to cumulative noradrenaline concentrations were recorded
      and followed by dose-dependent dilator responses to acetylcholine. The
      acetylcholine protocol was repeated after incubation with a nitric oxide synthase
      inhibitor (N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) and cyclooxygenase inhibitor
      (indomethacin). After perfusion with Ca(2+)-free physiological saline solution,
      structural measurements were recorded at varying intraluminal pressures (3-180 mm
      Hg). RESULTS: Wall thickness and wall:lumen ratio were increased in AD, reduced
      with treatment but remained greater in CD than controls. Wall cross-sectional
      area was increased in AD vs. controls (P < 0.001), decreased with treatment (AD
      vs. CD, P < 0.001), but remained higher than controls (CD vs. controls, P =
      0.015). Growth index was increased in AD (20%) compared to controls (CD, 9%).
      Contractility was similar in all groups. Endothelial-dependent dysfunction was
      evident in AD compared with CD (P < 0.001) and controls (P < 0.01). Dilation did 
      not change after N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester but was impaired after
      indomethacin incubation. CONCLUSION: Active acromegaly is associated with
      hypertrophic remodeling of the vascular wall and embarrassed endothelial function
      due to reduced nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor
      bioavailability, both of which may contribute to the early mortality from
      cardiovascular disease.

PG  - 288-94
LID - 10.1007/s10384-015-0396-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of 23-gauge (G) and 25G vitrectomy to 20G
      vitrectomy on eyes with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). METHODS:
      The medical records of 424 eyes of 347 patients with severe PDR were reviewed.
      There were 80 eyes that had 23G, 174 eyes that had 25G, and 170 eyes that had 20G
      vitrectomy. The incidences of postoperative vitreous hemorrhage, intraoperative
      retinal breaks, retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma were compared.
      RESULTS: The incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks was significantly lower
      in the 23G group (21 %) than in the 20G group (35 %, P = 0.03) but not in the 25G
      group (26 %, P = 0.057). The incidence of postoperative retinal detachment was
      not significantly different among the three groups (P = 0.73). The incidence of
      postoperative vitreous hemorrhage that developed >/=1 month after vitrectomy was 
      not different whether the eyes had panretinal photocoagulation or not (P = 0.15).
      The incidence of postoperative neovascular glaucoma was significantly lower in
      the 25G group (3 %) than in the 20G group (11 %, P = 0.01) but not significant
      compared with that in the 23G group (8 %, P = 0.72). CONCLUSION: The lower
      incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks and postoperative neovascular glaucoma
      after microincision vitrectomy indicates that microincision vitrectomy should be 
      considered for eyes with severe PDR.

AB  - We present materialization of single multicomposite nanowire (SMNW)-entrapped ZnO
      nanoparticles (NPs) via an electrochemical growth method, which is a newly
      developed fabrication method to grow a single nanowire between a pair of
      pre-patterned electrodes. Entrapment of ZnO NPs was controlled via different
      conditions of SMNW fabrication such as an applied potential and mixture ratio of 
      NPs and aniline solution. The controlled concentration of ZnO NP results in
      changes in the physical properties of the SMNWs, as shown in transmission
      electron microscopy images. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity and
      elasticity of SMNWs show improvement over those of pure polyaniline nanowire. The
      new nano-multicomposite material showed synergistic effects on mechanical and
      electrical properties, with logarithmical change and saturation increasing ZnO NP
      concentration.

TI  - Highly sensitive thermal conductivity measurements of suspended membranes (SiN
      and diamond) using a 3omega-Volklein method.
PG  - 054902
LID - 10.1063/1.4704086 [doi]
AB  - A suspended system for measuring the thermal properties of membranes is
      presented. The sensitive thermal measurement is based on the 3omega dynamic
      method coupled to a Volklein geometry. The device obtained using micro-machining 
      processes allows the measurement of the in-plane thermal conductivity of a
      membrane with a sensitivity of less than 10 nW/K (+-5 x 10(-3) Wm(-1) K(-1) at
      room temperature) and a very high resolution (DeltaK/K = 10(-3)). A transducer
      (heater/thermometer) centered on the membrane is used to create an oscillation of
      the heat flux and to measure the temperature oscillation at the third harmonic
      using a Wheatstone bridge set-up. Power as low as 0.1 nW has been measured at
      room temperature. The method has been applied to measure thermal properties of
      low stress silicon nitride and polycrystalline diamond membranes with thickness
      ranging from 100 nm to 400 nm. The thermal conductivity measured on the
      polycrystalline diamond membrane support a significant grain size effect on the
      thermal transport.

TI  - Validity and reliability of measurement of capillary refill time in children: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 239-49
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2014-307079 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most guidelines recommend the use of capillary refill time (CRT) as
      part of the routine assessment of unwell children, but there is little consensus 
      on the optimum method of measurement and cut-off time. METHODS: We searched
      Medline (from 1948), Embase (from 1980) and CINAHL (from 1991) to June 2014 to
      identify studies with information on the normal range of CRT in healthy children,
      the validity of CRT compared with reference standard measures of haemodynamic
      status, reliability and factors influencing measurement of CRT, such as body
      site, pressing time and temperature. FINDINGS: We included 21 studies on 1915
      children. Four studies provided information on the relationship between CRT and
      measures of cardiovascular status, 13 provided data on the normal range of CRT, 7
      provided data on reliability and 10 assessed the effect of various confounding
      factors. In children over 7 days of age, the upper limit of normal CRT is
      approximately 2 s when measured on a finger, and 4 s when measured on the chest
      or foot, irrespective of whether the child is feverish or not. Longer pressing
      times and ambient temperature outside 20 degrees C-25 degrees C are associated
      with longer CRT. Evidence suggests that the use of stopwatches reduces
      variability between observers. INTERPRETATION: We recommend use of the following 
      standardised CRT method of measurement: press on the finger for 5 s using
      moderate pressure at an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C-25 degrees C. A
      capillary refill time of 3 s or more should be considered abnormal.

AB  - Platelet-dependent thrombus formation may be influenced by alteration of platelet
      or vascular redox state, the presence of endogenous or exogenous antioxidants, as
      well as the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Specifically,
      settings and pathways that influence the formation of superoxide and nitric
      oxide, as well as their metabolism, may influence platelet function and thrombus 
      formation. Although some antioxidant regimens have been associated with bleeding 
      and hemorrhagic stroke, the therapeutic value of antioxidants in clinical
      syndromes that lead to platelet-dependent thrombosis is not clear, as
      supplemental antioxidants have not been generally associated with better
      cardiovascular outcome.

TI  - Macrophage-targeted photodynamic therapy: scavenger receptor expression and
      activation state.
PG  - 391-402
AB  - Macrophage-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) may have applications in the
      selective killing of cells involved in atherosclerosis, inflammation and tumor.
      We have previously shown that a conjugate between the photosensitizer chlorin(e6)
      (ce6) and maleylated bovine serum albumin (BSA-mal) gives highly selective
      targeting to macrophages. In this report we examine the effect of macrophage
      activation and scavenger receptor class A (SRA) expression on this targeting in
      two murine macrophage tumor cell lines (RAW264.7 and P388D1) and a control murine
      mammary sarcoma cell line (EMT-6). Cells were pretreated with interferon gamma
      (IFNgamma) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed byBSA-ce6-mal addition, and
      SRA expression, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) release, conjugate uptake 
      and PDT killing were measured. Both macrophage cell lines expressed SRA and took 
      up conjugate specifically in an SRA-dependent manner, but differences were
      observed in their response to activation. RAW264.7 expressed increasingly more
      SRA and took up increasingly more BSA-ce6-mal in response to IFNgamma, LPS, and
      IFNgamma+LPS, respectively. The PDT killing did not follow the same pattern as
      the uptake of the photosensitizer. The increase in uptake in the IFNgamma treated
      cells did not lead to an increase in PDT killing, while stimulation with LPS or
      IFNgamma + LPS resulted in a significant protection against PDT, despite a
      significant increase in photosensitizer uptake. P388D1 was responsive to neither 
      IFNgamma, nor to LPS, or to IFNgamma +LPS with respect to SRA expression,
      conjugate uptake, and PDT killing. These data may have implications for the use
      of PDT to target physiologically undesirable macrophage subtypes implicated in
      disease, and on how manipulation of the activation status of the macrophage will 
      influence the PDT effect.

TI  - Activity-dependent BDNF release via endocytic pathways is regulated by
      synaptotagmin-6 and complexin.
PG  - E4475-84
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1511830112 [doi]
AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to modulate synapse development
      and plasticity, but the source of synaptic BDNF and molecular mechanisms
      regulating BDNF release remain unclear. Using exogenous BDNF tagged with quantum 
      dots (BDNF-QDs), we found that endocytosed BDNF-QDs were preferentially localized
      to postsynaptic sites in the dendrite of cultured hippocampal neurons. Repetitive
      neuronal spiking induced the release of BDNF-QDs at these sites, and this process
      required activation of glutamate receptors. Down-regulating complexin 1/2
      (Cpx1/2) expression eliminated activity-induced BDNF-QD secretion, although the
      overall activity-independent secretion was elevated. Among eight synaptotagmin
      (Syt) isoforms examined, down-regulation of only Syt6 impaired activity-induced
      BDNF-QD secretion. In contrast, activity-induced release of endogenously
      synthesized BDNF did not depend on Syt6. Thus, neuronal activity could trigger
      the release of endosomal BDNF from postsynaptic dendrites in a Cpx- and
      Syt6-dependent manner, and endosomes containing BDNF may serve as a source of
      BDNF for activity-dependent synaptic modulation.

TI  - Are children with chronic illnesses requiring dietary therapy at risk for
      disordered eating or eating disorders? A systematic review.
PG  - 187-213
LID - 10.1002/eat.22831 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pediatric chronic illnesses (CI) can affect a child's mental health.
      Chronic illnesses with treatment regimens that specify a therapeutic diet may
      place the child at increased risk for disordered eating and specific eating
      disorders (ED). The aim of this review is to examine the relation between
      diet-treated CI and disordered eating and to determine the order of onset to
      infer directionality. Diet-treated CI is hypothesized to precede and to be
      associated with disordered eating. METHOD: A comprehensive search of empirical
      articles that examine the relation between diet-treated CI (diabetes, cystic
      fibrosis, celiac disease, gastrointestinal disorders, and inflammatory bowel
      diseases) and disordered eating was conducted in Medline and PsycINFO using the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A 
      table of the sample's characteristics, ED measures, major pertinent findings, and
      the onset of CI in relation to ED were provided. RESULTS: Diet-treated CI was
      associated with disordered eating and ED. Diet-treated CI had onset prior to
      disordered eating in most studies, except for inflammatory bowel diseases.
      Disordered eating and unhealthy weight management practices put children at risk 
      for poor medical outcomes. DISCUSSION: Interventions for diet-treated CI require 
      a focus on diet and weight, but may increase the risk for disordered eating.
      Future research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that transform standard
      treatment practices into pathological eating, including characteristics and
      behaviors of the child, parents/care providers, family, and treatment providers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Miliary tuberculosis is a severe, acute form of tuberculosis due to
      lymphohaematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli from a focal lesion.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study of was undertaken at the Pneumology
      Clinic of the National University Hospital Centre (CHUN) of Fann, over a period
      of 30 months (January 2007-June 2009), in order to assess the epidemiological,
      clinical, paraclinical and evolutionary aspects of miliary tuberculosis. RESULTS:
      Miliary tuberculosis accounted for 3.8% (n=49) of all diagnosed cases of
      tuberculosis. The sex-ratio was 1.7. The average age of patients was 37.5 years
      with a range of 15 to 70 years. The typical radiological appearances were present
      in 88% of cases whereas only 10% were positive on direct smear. HIV serology was 
      positive in 29%. In the hospital environment, the mortality was 12.2%.
      CONCLUSION: Miliary tuberculosis is a severe form of the disease. The prognosis
      depends on early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Etiology and prognosis of acute viral encephalitis and meningitis in Chinese
      children: a multicentre prospective study.
PG  - 494
LID - 10.1186/s12879-017-2572-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In China, there were few studies about the pathogens of acute viral
      encephalitis and meningitis in children in recent years. The aims of this study
      were to characterize the etiology and prognosis of acute viral encephalitis and
      meningitis in Chinese children. METHODS: This was a multicentre prospective
      study. Two hundred and sixty one viral encephalitis patients and 285 viral
      meningitis patients were enrolled. The mean age of viral encephalitis and
      meningitis were 5.88 +/- 3.60 years and 6.39 +/- 3.57 years, respectively.
      Real-time reverse transcription PCR and multiplex PCR were used to detect human
      enteroviruses and herpes viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with
      encephalitis or meningitis. The enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay (ELISA) was 
      used for detecting IgM antibody against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in CSF 
      and against mumps virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), dengue virus and
      rubella virus in acute serum. The clinical and outcome data were collected during
      patients' hospitalization. RESULTS: The etiology of viral encephalitis was
      confirmed in 52.5% patients. The primary pathogen was human enteroviruses (27.7%)
      in viral encephalitis. The incidence of sequelae and the fatality rate of viral
      encephalitis with confirmed etiology were 7.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The
      etiology of viral meningitis was identified in 42.8% cases. The leading pathogen 
      was also human enteroviruses (37.7%) in viral meningitis. The prognosis of viral 
      meningitis was favorable with only 0.7% patients had neurological sequelae.
      CONCLUSIONS: Human enteroviruses were the leading cause both in acute viral
      encephalitis and viral meningitis in children. The incidence of sequelae and
      fatality rate of viral encephalitis with confirmed etiology were 7.5% and 0.8%,
      respectively. The prognosis of viral meningitis was favorable compared to viral
      encephalitis.

TI  - Rosuvastatin elicits KDR-dependent vasculogenic response of human placental stem 
      cells through PI3K/AKT pathway.
PG  - 275-84
LID - 10.1016/j.phrs.2011.12.004 [doi]
AB  - The growth and plasticity of engrafted human mesenchymal stem cells is regulated 
      by external stimuli. Rosuvastatin (RSV) promotes myocardial neovascularization
      and limits myocardial remodeling in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
      While these non-lipid benefits may in part depend on the activation of stem
      cells, experimental evidence that RSV directly elicits vasculogenic
      differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells is still lacking. We assessed
      whether RSV may drive a gene program of vascular commitment and the secretion of 
      trophic mediators with antiapoptotic, angiogenic and antifibrotic activities in
      human mesenchymal stem cells from full-term placentas (FMhMSCs). With real-time
      RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, chemiluminescence, Western blot analysis, and in
      vitro vasculogenesis assays, we show that RSV enhanced expression of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), encoding a
      major VEGF receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and platelet-derived growth 
      factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. GATA-4 and Nkx-2.5
      transcription was not affected. RSV enhanced capillary-like formation in vitro,
      but capillary-embedded FMhMSCs lacked endothelial marker expression, suggesting a
      role of pericyte-like elements in tube formation. In HUVEC/FMhMSC cocultures, RSV
      increases PDGFRbeta expression in FMhMSCs, and enhanced capillary density and
      organizational efficiency, promoting a long-lasting survival of tubular networks.
      RSV also activated PI3K-Akt pathway; the vasculogenic effects of the statin were 
      abrogated following PI3K inhibition by LY294002. In conclusion, RSV-induced
      increase in capillary formation was dependent on VEGF and KDR. RSV promotes the
      activation of paracrine signals for vascular commitment of FMhMSCs through
      PI3K-Akt pathway. This observation may pave the way to the use of RSV as a
      pharmacological enhancer of stem cell potential for cardiovascular cell therapy.

LID - 10.1063/1.3276680 [doi]
AB  - Polar solvation dynamics of coumarin 153 in acetonitrile, methanol, and butanol
      are investigated by dynamic Stokes shift function, S(t). In small protic
      solvents, it is known that an initial ultrafast component below 50 fs constitutes
      more than half of the total solvation process. We use fluorescence up-conversion 
      technique via two-photon absorption process, which can provide 40 fs time
      resolution for the whole emission wavelength range. Moreover, time-resolved
      fluorescence spectra are recorded directly without the spectral reconstruction.
      We observe a temporal oscillation in frequency of whole emission spectrum in the 
      solvation curve. In the obtained S(t), initial solvation time scale is 120 fs,
      invariant to solvents used in this experiment, although its amplitude varies in
      different solvents.

TI  - Mapping N-linked glycosylation sites in the secretome and whole cells of
      Aspergillus niger using hydrazide chemistry and mass spectrometry.
PG  - 143-56
LID - 10.1021/pr200916k [doi]
AB  - Protein glycosylation (e.g., N-linked glycosylation) is known to play an
      essential role in both cellular functions and secretory pathways; however, our
      knowledge of in vivo N-glycosylated sites is very limited for the majority of
      fungal organisms including Aspergillus niger. Herein, we present the first
      extensive mapping of N-glycosylated sites in A. niger by applying an optimized
      solid phase glycopeptide enrichment protocol using hydrazide-modified magnetic
      beads. The enrichment protocol was initially optimized using both mouse blood
      plasma and A. niger secretome samples, and it was demonstrated that the
      protein-level enrichment protocol offered superior performance over the
      peptide-level protocol. The optimized protocol was then applied to profile
      N-glycosylated sites from both the secretome and whole cell lysates of A. niger. 
      A total of 847 N-glycosylated sites from 330 N-glycoproteins (156 proteins from
      the secretome and 279 proteins from whole cells) were confidently identified by
      LC-MS/MS. The identified N-glycoproteins in the whole cell lysate were primarily 
      localized in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,
      lysosome, and storage vacuoles, supporting the important role of N-glycosylation 
      in the secretory pathways. In addition, these glycoproteins are involved in many 
      biological processes including gene regulation, signal transduction, protein
      folding and assembly, protein modification, and carbohydrate metabolism. The
      extensive coverage of N-glycosylated sites and the observation of partial glycan 
      occupancy on specific sites in a number of enzymes provide important initial
      information for functional studies of N-linked glycosylation and their
      biotechnological applications in A. niger.

TI  - [Cholinesterase inhibitors in dementia: the precarious balance between efficacy
      and safety].
PG  - 530-2
AB  - Cholinesterase inhibitors are widely prescribed in patients with Alzheimer's
      disease. Recently it has become clear that using these medications increases the 
      risk of serious adverse events like cardiac arrhythmias, and some studies report 
      a much-increased mortality in the treatment group on comparison with the placebo 
      group. In the light of the at best, modest, treatment effects, we advocate that
      the safety of cholinesterase inhibitors should be the subject of continuing,
      intense scrutiny. Efforts should be made to delineate the profile of a true
      'cholinergic deficiency syndrome', in order to be able to prescribe these
      medications to a group of patients in whom the benefits outweigh the risks.

TI  - Sonographic assessment of fetal subcutaneous fat tissue thickness as an indicator
      of gestational diabetes.
PG  - 157-62
LID - 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.05.035 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We used ultrasound to measure fetal subcutaneous fat in pregnancies
      with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance tests (GTT). STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-five
      women with singleton pregnancies between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation participated 
      in our study. We measured fetal subcutaneous fat tissue thickness in 20 women
      with abnormal GTT (Group A, study group) and 15 women with normal GTT (Group B,
      control group). Maximum subcutaneous fat tissue thickness of the fetuses was
      measured at three different levels of the fetal body, from the inner to the outer
      aspect of the echogenic subcutaneous fat. One measurement was taken at the level 
      of the biparietal diameter (BPD), a second at the level of the abdominal
      circumference (AC) and the third was performed sagittally at the level of the
      thoracic spine (TS). RESULTS: Each variable was tested separately for
      statistically significant differences between the two groups using two
      statistical tests, the parametric Student's t-test and the non-parametric
      Mann-Whitney (M-W) test. Both tests verified a statistically significant
      difference for the three variables of interest (HC, AC and TS) between the two
      groups. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the
      diagnostic value of each of the three variables regarding the detection of
      gestational diabetes. Finally, all three variables were used to construct a
      linear discriminant analysis model in order to evaluate their combined
      discrimination ability. CONCLUSION: Assessing these parameters using a
      noninvasive tool such as ultrasound could enhance the detection of gestational
      diabetes and limit the potential morbidity resulting from undiagnosed gestational
      diabetes. It could be useful in women who are unable to tolerate GTT or have poor
      follow-up during pregnancy.

PG  - 171
LID - 10.1186/1742-2094-8-171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a prominent feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It
      has been proposed that aging has an effect on the function of inflammation in the
      brain, thereby contributing to the development of age-related diseases like AD.
      However, the age-dependent relationship between inflammation and clinical
      phenotype of AD has never been investigated. METHODS: In this study we have
      analysed features of the neuroinflammatory response in clinically and
      pathologically confirmed AD and control cases in relation to age (range 52-97
      years). The mid-temporal cortex of 19 controls and 19 AD cases was assessed for
      the occurrence of microglia and astrocytes by immunohistochemistry using
      antibodies directed against CD68 (KP1), HLA class II (CR3/43) and glial
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). RESULTS: By measuring the area density of
      immunoreactivity we found significantly more microglia and astrocytes in AD cases
      younger than 80 years compared to older AD patients. In addition, the presence of
      KP1, CR3/43 and GFAP decreases significantly with increasing age in AD.
      CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the association between neuroinflammation and
      AD is stronger in relatively young patients than in the oldest patients. This
      age-dependent relationship between inflammation and clinical phenotype of AD has 
      implications for the interpretation of biomarkers and treatment of the disease.

TI  - THE CONCISE GUIDE TO PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18: G protein-coupled receptors.
PG  - S17-S129
LID - 10.1111/bph.13878 [doi]
AB  - The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18 provides concise overviews of the key
      properties of nearly 1800 human drug targets with an emphasis on selective
      pharmacology (where available), plus links to an open access knowledgebase of
      drug targets and their ligands (www.guidetopharmacology.org), which provides more
      detailed views of target and ligand properties. Although the Concise Guide
      represents approximately 400 pages, the material presented is substantially
      reduced compared to information and links presented on the website. It provides a
      permanent, citable, point-in-time record that will survive database updates. The 
      full contents of this section can be found at
      http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.13878/full. G protein-coupled
      receptors are one of the eight major pharmacological targets into which the Guide
      is divided, with the others being: ligand-gated ion channels, voltage-gated ion
      channels, other ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic receptors,
      enzymes and transporters. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and
      summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key
      references and suggestions for further reading. The landscape format of the
      Concise Guide is designed to facilitate comparison of related targets from
      material contemporary to mid-2017, and supersedes data presented in the 2015/16
      and 2013/14 Concise Guides and previous Guides to Receptors and Channels. It is
      produced in close conjunction with the Nomenclature Committee of the Union of
      Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (NC-IUPHAR), therefore, providing official IUPHAR
      classification and nomenclature for human drug targets, where appropriate.

TI  - [Studies on sensitization for electrochemiluminescence of luminol with
      platinum-gold bimetallic nanoparticles modified electrode].
PG  - 2785-8
AB  - The present paper reports the researches on sensitization of nano-bimetalic
      material for the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of luminol. The platinum-gold
      bimetallic nanoparticles with different component ratio and size were prepared by
      chemical reduction. The analytical methods such as UV-Vis spectra, TEM and XRD
      were applied to characterize the properties ofthe nanoparticles. The information 
      obtained from these methods revealed that the prepared bimetallic nanoparticles
      were truly of alloy structure and absolutely not the mixture of two kinds of
      metallic nanoparticles. The components of the nanoparticles could be regulated
      for a series of Pt/Au ratios and the diameters determined by laser-granulometer. 
      In alkaline medium of pH 12.0, the bimetallic Pt-Au nanoparticle modified
      electrode sensitized the electrochemiluminescence of luminol. The sensitization
      efficiency reached as high as one order of magnitude with the 6:1 of Pt/Au ratio.
      The specific surface area of nanoparticles would be larger as the size
      diminishes, resulting in a higher surface activity, so the smallest size of
      nanoparticles led to the highest efficiency.

TI  - Cultural competence in nursing: new meanings.
PG  - 82-8
AB  - Shortages of nurses challenge the provision of health care in developed countries
      including those in the European Union (EU), but there has been no upward trend in
      recruitment of nurses from EU countries with a surplus. A remedy is to facilitate
      migration of nurses around Europe. However, the importance of the concept of
      cultural competence has been overlooked within EU health care systems. Migrant
      nurses from EU countries employed in the United Kingdom indicate that they have
      experienced problems arising from a variety of issues related to cultural
      diversity. Countries such as the United Kingdom could benefit from introducing
      enculturation courses for migrant nurses.

TI  - Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Pediatrics.
PG  - 630-6
LID - 10.1097/PEC.0000000000000895 [doi]
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the pediatric population is a rare and potentially
      devastating occurrence. An understanding of the differential diagnosis for the
      etiology of the cardiac arrest allows for the most effective emergency care and
      provides the patient with the best possible outcome. Pediatric SCA can occur with
      or without prodromal symptoms and may occur during exercise or rest. The most
      common cause is arrhythmia secondary to an underlying channelopathy,
      cardiomyopathy, or myocarditis. After stabilization, evaluation should include
      electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and echocardiogram. Management should focus 
      on decreasing the potential for recurring arrhythmia, maintaining cardiac
      preload, and thoughtful medication use to prevent exacerbation of the underlying 
      condition. The purpose of this review was to provide the emergency physician with
      a concise and current review of the incidence, differential diagnosis, and
      management of pediatric patients presenting with SCA.

TI  - Combining remote sensing and eddy covariance data to monitor the gross primary
      production of an estuarine wetland ecosystem in East China.
PG  - 753-62
LID - 10.1039/c5em00061k [doi]
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are very important for ecological diversity and have a strong 
      ability to sequester carbon. Through comparisons with field measured eddy
      covariance data, we evaluated the relationships between the light use efficiency 
      (LUE) index and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference
      vegetation index (NDVI), and land surface temperature (LST). Consequently, we
      have proposed a new model for the estimation of gross primary production (GPP)
      for wetland ecosystems using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
      (MODIS) products, including these vegetation indices, LST and the fraction of
      photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) absorbed by the active vegetation.
      This model was developed and validated for a study site on Chongming Island,
      Shanghai, China. Our results show that photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) 
      was highly correlated with the LST, with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of
      0.59 (p < 0.001). Vegetation indices, such as EVI, NDVI and LST, were highly
      correlated with LUE. We found that the product of vegetation indices (VIs) and a 
      modified form of LST (Te) can be used to estimate LUE, with an R(2) of 0.82 (P < 
      0.0001) and an RMSE of 0.054 kg C per mol PAR. This new model can provide
      reliable estimates of GPP (R(2) of 0.87 and RMSE of 0.009 kg C m(-2) 8 d(-1) (P <
      0.0001)).

TI  - Longitudinal analyses of early lesions by fluorescence: an observational study.
PG  - 84S-9S
LID - 10.1177/0022034513490167 [doi]
AB  - Previous caries experience correlates to future caries risk; thus, early
      identification of lesions has importance for risk assessment and management. In
      this study, we aimed to determine if Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence
      (QLF) parameters--area (A [mm(2)]), fluorescence loss (F [%]), and Q [% x
      mm(2)]--obtained by image analyses can predict lesion progression. We secured
      consent from 565 children (from 5-13 years old) and their parents/guardians and
      examined them at baseline and regular intervals over 48 months according to the
      International Caries Detection Assessment System (ICDAS), yearly radiographs, and
      QLF. QLF images from surfaces with ICDAS 0/1/2/3/4 at baseline that progressed (N
      = 2,191) to cavitation (ICDAS 5/6) or fillings and surfaces that did not progress
      to cavitation/fillings (N = 4,141) were analyzed independently for A, F, and Q.
      Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare means and slopes (changes over
      time) between surfaces that progressed and those that did not. QLF A, F, and Q
      increased at a faster rate for surfaces that progressed than for surfaces that
      did not progress (p = .0001), regardless of type of surface or baseline ICDAS
      score. AUC for ICDAS ranged from 0.65 to 0.80, but adding QLF information
      improved AUC (0.82-0.87, p < .0005). We concluded that faster changes in QLF
      variables can indicate lesion progression toward cavitation and be more
      clinically relevant than actual QLF values.

TI  - Propane sigma-Complexes on PdO(101): Spectroscopic Evidence of the Selective
      Coordination and Activation of Primary C-H Bonds.
PG  - 13907-11
LID - 10.1002/anie.201505237 [doi]
AB  - Achieving selective C-H bond cleavage is critical for developing catalytic
      processes that transform small alkanes to value-added products. The present study
      clarifies the molecular-level origin for an exceptionally strong preference for
      propane to dissociate on the crystalline PdO(101) surface via primary C-H bond
      cleavage. Using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and density
      functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that adsorbed propane
      sigma-complexes preferentially adopt geometries on PdO(101) in which only primary
      C-H bonds datively interact with the surface Pd atoms at low propane coverages
      and are thus activated under typical catalytic reaction conditions. We show that 
      a propane molecule achieves maximum stability on PdO(101) by adopting a bidentate
      geometry in which a H-Pd dative bond forms at each CH3 group. These results
      demonstrate that structural registry between the molecule and surface can
      strongly influence the selectivity of a metal oxide surface in activating alkane 
      C-H bonds.

PG  - 295-300
LID - 10.1080/00952990902968585 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increased awareness and attention towards methamphetamine
      (MA) use among men who have sex with men (MSM), few studies have examined
      behaviors and effects of MA use among heterosexual populations. OBJECTIVE: To
      learn whether behaviors and effects of MA use among heterosexuals differ
      according to gender. METHODS: We examined gender differences in sociodemographic 
      characteristics, drug use practices, sexual behaviors, and consequences and
      motivations for MA use among 452 HIV-negative MA users (306 men, 146 women) who
      had engaged in unprotected sex and used MA in the previous two months. RESULTS:
      Females in the sample were younger and more likely to be married, to have been
      diagnosed with an STI in the last two months, and to report having been
      introduced to MA by a sexual partner. Women were also more likely to experience
      depressive symptoms and to report using MA "to lose weight." Men were more likely
      to engage in sex marathons while high on MA and to use MA "to enhance sexual
      pleasure." CONCLUSION: These differences suggest the importance of crafting
      gender-specific intervention messages, and they may contribute to identifying
      individuals at risk for initiating MA use. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings 
      contribute to our knowledge of gender differences in behaviors and effects of MA 
      use among heterosexuals. Future studies would benefit from collection of
      longitudinal data (to assess causal relationships) and use of a control group (to
      distinguish correlates of MA use from those of drug use in general).

      published in the last decade (1998-2008) that examined variables related to the
      health beliefs and behaviors of women with previous gestational diabetes
      mellitus. Keyword searches included health beliefs, health behaviors, perceived
      risk, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, diet, physical activity, and
      postpartum. STUDY SELECTION: Eight articles, representing 6 studies, were
      selected that met the inclusion criteria of original research, dependent variable
      of health beliefs and behaviors of women with previous gestational diabetes
      mellitus, and measurement after pregnancy. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were
      reviewed and discussed according to the concepts of risk perception and health
      beliefs, health behaviors related to diet and physical activity, and psychosocial
      factors related to women's health beliefs and behaviors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data
      revealed common health beliefs and behaviors of women with previous gestational
      diabetes mellitus, including low risk perceptions for future type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and suboptimal levels of physical activity and fruit and vegetable
      intake. The majority of studies revealed a distinct knowledge-behavior gap among 
      women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus, whereas others revealed a lack
      of knowledge regarding necessary lifestyle modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
      from this review may assist women's health researchers and clinicians in
      developing appropriate interventions for increasing risk awareness, promoting
      self-efficacy for weight loss and physical activity behaviors, and decreasing
      rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease among women with previous
      gestational diabetes mellitus. Further research is necessary to identify factors 
      that influence the health beliefs and behaviors of women with previous
      gestational diabetes mellitus. Future research should focus on populations of
      greater racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity, as the majority of studies
      have been conducted with non-Hispanic White, socioeconomically advantaged women.

AB  - IBD syndromes such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis result from the
      inflammation of specific intestinal segments. Although many studies have reported
      on the regenerative response of intestinal progenitor and stem cells to tissue
      injury, very little is known about the response of differentiated lineages to
      inflammatory cues. Here, we show that acute inflammation of the mouse small
      intestine is followed by a dramatic loss of Lgr5(+) stem cells. Instead, Paneth
      cells re-enter the cell cycle, lose their secretory expression signature, and
      acquire stem-like properties, thus contributing to the tissue regenerative
      response to inflammation. Stem cell factor secretion upon inflammation triggers
      signaling through the c-Kit receptor and a cascade of downstream events
      culminating in GSK3beta inhibition and Wnt activation in Paneth cells. Hence, the
      plasticity of the intestinal epithelium in response to inflammation goes well
      beyond stem and progenitor cells and extends to the fully differentiated and
      post-mitotic Paneth cells.

TI  - Org 25969 (sugammadex), a selective relaxant binding agent for antagonism of
      prolonged rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.
PG  - 36-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Org 25969 is a cyclodextrin compound designed to reverse a
      rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. The aim of this study was to explore the 
      efficacy, dose-response relation and safety of Org 25969 for reversal of a
      prolonged rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. METHODS: Thirty anaesthetized
      adult patients received rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1) as an initial dose followed by
      increments to maintain a deep block at a level of <10 PTCs (post-tetanic counts) 
      recorded every 6 min. Neuromuscular monitoring was carried out using
      accelerometry, in a train-of-four (TOF) mode using TOF-WatchSX. At recovery of
      T2, following at least 2 h of neuromuscular block, patients received their
      randomly assigned dose of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 or 6.0 mg kg(-1) of Org 25969.
      Anaesthesia and neuromuscular monitoring were continued for a minimum period of
      30 min after Org 25969 administration. The main end-point of the study was the
      time to achieve a sustained recovery of TOF ratio to 0.9. Patients were followed 
      up for 7 days after anaesthesia. RESULTS: The results showed a dose-related
      decrease in the average time taken to attain a TOF ratio of 0.9 from 6:49 (min:s)
      with the 0.5 mg kg(-1) dose to 1:22 with the 4.0 mg kg(-1) dose. Weighted
      non-linear regression analysis showed the fastest achievable time to TOF ratio of
      0.9 to be 1:35. Org 25969 produced no major adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Org
      25969 effectively reversed a deep and prolonged neuromuscular block induced by
      rocuronium. The effective reversal dose appears to be 2-4 mg kg(-1).

TI  - Asphyxia-activated corticocardiac signaling accelerates onset of cardiac arrest.
PG  - E2073-82
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1423936112 [doi]
AB  - The mechanism by which the healthy heart and brain die rapidly in the absence of 
      oxygen is not well understood. We performed continuous electrocardiography and
      electroencephalography in rats undergoing experimental asphyxia and analyzed
      cortical release of core neurotransmitters, changes in brain and heart electrical
      activity, and brain-heart connectivity. Asphyxia stimulates a robust and
      sustained increase of functional and effective cortical connectivity, an
      immediate increase in cortical release of a large set of neurotransmitters, and a
      delayed activation of corticocardiac functional and effective connectivity that
      persists until the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Blocking the brain's
      autonomic outflow significantly delayed terminal ventricular fibrillation and
      lengthened the duration of detectable cortical activities despite the continued
      absence of oxygen. These results demonstrate that asphyxia activates a
      brainstorm, which accelerates premature death of the heart and the brain.

      biological function and structure.
PG  - 17-33
LID - 10.1021/pr100556z [doi]
AB  - The "a disintegrin and metalloproteases" (ADAMs) are membrane-anchored metzincins
      of the adamalysin subfamily. This review gives an overview over the biological
      function and structure of ADAMs focusing on members of the family that display
      proteolytic activity. ADAMs are involved in a range of human diseases such as
      cancer metastasis, inflammatory disorders, neurological disease or asthma. It is,
      however, often difficult to assign a definitive role to a specific member of the 
      ADAM family in a given disease mechanism due to overlapping activities and
      redundancy in function, as shown in various knock-out studies. The review
      discusses the structural domains that are not directly linked to protease
      activity followed by a more detailed overview over the role of the
      metalloprotease domain. Different family members are critically reviewed with
      respect to their role in biological processes with particular emphasis on
      disease-relevant functions.

PG  - 79-81
AB  - This paper describes a case of Caroli's disease in a female patient aged 32, who 
      complained of nonspecific abdominal pain without cholesthasis or cholangitis.
      Liver resonance shows segment saccular dilations closely connected to
      intrahepatic biliary ducts, that differ from the Caroli's syndrome, which is more
      common and consists of multiple intrahepatic cystic dilatations, associated to
      congenital hepatic fibrosis. This patient has a congenital anomaly with an
      uncommon oligosymptomatic form of Caroli's disease that should be included in the
      differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent abdominal pain.

      endothelial cell angiogenesis.
PG  - 251-67

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Reduced capillary density occurs early in cardiovascular diseases.
      Oxidant stress is implicated in endothelial apoptosis. We investigated the
      effects of xanthine oxidase (XO) on endothelial survival signaling: protein
      kinase B/Akt, its cross-talk with p38 MAPK and apoptosis pathways, and its effect
      on vascular tube formation in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-simulated
      human umbilical vein cells. METHODS: We studied primary cultured human
      endothelial cells from the umbilical cord. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      production was detected by dihydroethidium staining, cell-signaling pathways by
      western blots, cell survival by western blots, and nuclear chromatin and
      angiogenesis response by MTT proliferation assay and three-dimensional Matrigel
      cultures. RESULTS: Exogenous XO increased cellular ROS production and caused
      superoxide-dependent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and enhancement of p38
      MAPK phosphorylation in a time-and dose-dependent manner. In contrast,
      application of the XO inhibitor oxypurinol or allopurinol inhibited
      VEGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, indicating that endogenous XO promotes
      VEGF-induced endothelial cell (EC) survival signaling. Exogenous XO induced
      activation of caspase-3 and reduced expression of the anti-apoptosis protein
      Bcl-2. Exogenous XO also reduced EC viability, proliferation, and vascular tube
      formation by p38 MAPK-dependent, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) reversible
      mechanisms; whereas VEGF promoted EC survival by PI3-K-dependent, p38
      MAPK-independent effects. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous XO activity is an important
      contributor to endothelial mechanisms for microvascular rarefaction, by
      modulation of cell survival signaling pathways; however, endogenous XO is
      necessary for maintaining EC survival.

AB  - Self-deception is widespread in humans even though it can lead to disastrous
      consequences such as airplane crashes and financial meltdowns. Why is this
      potentially harmful trait so common? A controversial theory proposes that
      self-deception evolved to facilitate the deception of others. We test this
      hypothesis in the real world and find support for it: Overconfident individuals
      are overrated by observers and underconfident individuals are judged by observers
      to be worse than they actually are. Our findings suggest that people may not
      always reward the more accomplished individual but rather the more self-deceived.
      Moreover, if overconfident individuals are more likely to be risk-prone then by
      promoting them we may be creating institutions, including banks and armies, which
      are more vulnerable to risk. Our results reveal practical solutions for assessing
      individuals that circumvent the influence of self-deception and can be
      implemented in a range of organizations including educational institutions.

PG  - 517-23
LID - 10.1038/ki.2012.401 [doi]
AB  - The effect of intensive glucose control on major kidney outcomes in type 2
      diabetes remains unclear. To study this, the ADVANCE trial randomly assigned
      11,140 participants to an intensive glucose-lowering strategy (hemoglobin A1c
      target 6.5% or less) or standard glucose control. Treatment effects on end-stage 
      renal disease ((ESRD), requirement for dialysis or renal transplantation), total 
      kidney events, renal death, doubling of creatinine to above 200 mumol/l,
      new-onset macroalbuminuria or microalbuminuria, and progression or regression of 
      albuminuria, were then assessed. After a median of 5 years, the mean hemoglobin
      A1c level was 6.5% in the intensive group, and 7.3% in the standard group.
      Intensive glucose control significantly reduced the risk of ESRD by 65% (20
      compared to 7 events), microalbuminuria by 9% (1298 compared to 1410 patients),
      and macroalbuminuria by 30% (162 compared to 231 patients). The progression of
      albuminuria was significantly reduced by 10% and its regression significantly
      increased by 15%. The results were almost identical in analyses taking account of
      potential competing risks. The number of participants needed to treat over 5
      years to prevent one ESRD event ranged from 410 in the overall study to 41
      participants with macroalbuminuria at baseline. Thus, improved glucose control
      will improve major kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Health Care Use, Health Behaviors, and Medical Conditions Among Individuals in
      Same-Sex and Opposite-Sex Partnerships: A Cross-Sectional Observational Analysis 
      of the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS), 2003-2011.
PG  - 547-54

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research documents disparities between sexual minority and
      nonsexual minority individuals regarding health behaviors and health services
      utilization. However, little is known regarding differences in the prevalence of 
      medical conditions. OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between sexual minority
      status and medical conditions. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted multiple logistic
      regression analyses of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2003-2011). We
      identified individuals who reported being partnered with an individual of the
      same sex, and constructed a matched cohort of individuals in opposite-sex
      partnerships. SUBJECTS: A total of 494 individuals in same-sex partnerships and
      494 individuals in opposite-sex partnerships. MEASURES: Measures of health risk
      (eg, smoking status), health services utilization (eg, physician office visits), 
      and presence of 15 medical conditions (eg, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, HIV,
      alcohol disorders). RESULTS: Same-sex partnered men had nearly 4 times the odds
      of reporting a mood disorder than did opposite-sex partnered men [adjusted odds
      ratio (aOR)=3.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.85-8.48]. Compared with
      opposite-sex partnered women, same-sex partnered women had greater odds of heart 
      disease (aOR=2.59; 95% CI, 1.19-5.62), diabetes (aOR=2.75; 95% CI, 1.10-6.90),
      obesity (aOR=1.92; 95% CI, 1.26-2.94), high cholesterol (aOR=1.89; 95% CI,
      1.03-3.50), and asthma (aOR=1.90; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19). Even after adjusting for
      sociodemographics, health risk behaviors, and health conditions, individuals in
      same-sex partnerships had 67% increased odds of past-year emergency department
      utilization and 51% greater odds of >/=3 physician visits in the last year
      compared with opposite-sex partnered individuals. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of
      individual-level, provider-level, and system-level approaches are needed to
      reduce disparities in medical conditions and health care utilization among sexual
      minority individuals.

PG  - 1391-405
LID - 10.1111/pce.12071 [doi]
AB  - There are several well-described acclimation responses to excess light in green
      algae but the effect on metabolism has not been thoroughly investigated. This
      study examines the metabolic changes during photoacclimation to high-light (HL)
      stress in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using nuclear magnetic resonance and mass
      spectrometry. Using principal component analysis, a clear metabolic response to
      HL intensity was observed on global metabolite pools, with major changes in the
      levels of amino acids and related nitrogen metabolites. Amino acid pools
      increased during short-term photoacclimation, but were especially prominent in
      HL-acclimated cultures. Unexpectedly, we observed an increase in mitochondrial
      metabolism through downstream photorespiratory pathways. The expression of two
      genes encoding key enzymes in the photorespiratory pathway, glycolate
      dehydrogenase and malate synthase, were highly responsive to the HL stress. We
      propose that this pathway contributes to metabolite pools involved in nitrogen
      assimilation and may play a direct role in photoacclimation. Our results suggest 
      that primary and secondary metabolism is highly pliable and plays a critical role
      in coping with the energetic imbalance during HL exposure and a necessary
      adjustment to support an increased growth rate that is an effective energy sink
      for the excess reducing power generated during HL stress.

      hospitalized Asian elderly patients. METHODS: Case note review was done for all
      patients age 65 years and above, who fell at least once during their hospital
      stay over a 12-month period. Information obtained from the case notes included:
      (i) demographic information; (ii) Modified Morse Fall scale; (iii) circumstances 
      and time of fall; and (iv) medication use. From the hospital admission database, 
      an age- and sex-matched control group was selected for comparison. RESULTS: Over 
      the 12-month study period, 298 patients met the study criteria. Average age of
      the patients was 75.8 years, 60.4% were male and 84.9% were Chinese. Multivariate
      analysis showed that fallers had longer lengths of stay and were more likely to
      have a history of falls. Fallers were also more likely to be taking hypnotics,
      cough preparations and anti-platelets, but less likely to be taking paracetamol. 
      Fallers were on fewer medications. CONCLUSION: Elderly hospitalized patients on
      hypnotic drugs, cough preparations and anti-platelets were more likely to fall.
      Appropriate usage of analgesics, especially paracetamol, to relieve pain may
      reduce falls.

LID - 10.1021/acs.orglett.6b01894 [doi]
AB  - An investigation of the recently reported "fully catalytic Mitsunobu reaction"
      using catalytic amounts of a phosphine reagent and an azo reagent has shown that 
      although benzyl 4-nitrobenzoate is formed under the fully catalytic conditions,
      the same result is obtained if the hydrazine catalyst is omitted, indicating that
      this is not a Mitsunobu reaction. In addition, when the reaction between
      (-)-ethyl lactate and 4-nitrobenzoic acid was carried out using the "fully
      catalytic" method, the corresponding ester was formed but in very low yield and
      with predominant retention of configuration. Unfortunately, the system catalytic 
      in phosphine reagent is incompatible with that in the azo reagent.

TI  - The value of the ophthalmological independent medical examination: analysis of
      344 cases.
PG  - 1371-5
LID - 10.1136/bjo.2009.160614 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the value of the ophthalmological
      independent medical examination (IME) for detecting malingering, exaggerated or
      feigned symptoms, and incorrect causal relationship. DESIGN: Retrospective
      observational cohort study. METHODS: Consecutive examinees (n = 344) who
      underwent an IME by a single examiner between 1998 and 2005 in the setting of an 
      ophthalmological group practice were included in the study. Diagnoses were made
      to at least a degree of medical certainty. Main outcome measures were frequency
      of exaggerated, feigned and non-causally related pathology and symptoms. RESULTS:
      In 172 claimants (50%), the symptoms and pathology claimed were fully
      substantiated. The other 172 claimants were found to have either exaggerated or
      totally feigned symptoms and/or symptoms and pathology misattributed
      (non-causally related to the claimed accident or incident). The most frequent
      feigned/exaggerated symptoms were visual loss (74%), ocular pain/discomfort
      (28%), visual field loss (19%), headaches (17%) and photophobia (13%). Visual
      field loss and the symptoms of ocular discomfort, headaches, dizziness and
      epiphora were more frequent in the feigning group (p<0.01). In contrast,
      complaints of swelling and deformity were more frequent (p = 0.001) among the
      examinees with real pathology. Review of the medical records provided helpful
      information in 163/172 cases in the feigning group. CONCLUSIONS: An
      ophthalmological IME is useful for detecting malingering, as well as symptoms and
      pathology not causally related to a claimed accident or injury or actually
      pre-existent to a claimed date. The advantages of an IME compared with relying on
      treating-doctor records, clues for diagnosing feigning and incorrect causal
      relationship, and guidelines for performing an ophthalmological IME are
      discussed.

AB  - Driven by intergroup competition, social norms, beliefs, and practices can evolve
      in ways that more effectively tap into a wide variety of evolved psychological
      mechanisms to foster group-beneficial behavior. The more powerful such evolved

TI  - The UK HeartSpare Study: randomised evaluation of voluntary deep-inspiratory
      breath-hold in women undergoing breast radiotherapy.

LID - S0167-8140(13)00196-5 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether voluntary deep-inspiratory breath-hold (v_DIBH) and
      deep-inspiratory breath-hold with the active breathing coordinator (ABC_DIBH) in 
      patients undergoing left breast radiotherapy are comparable in terms of
      normal-tissue sparing, positional reproducibility and feasibility of delivery.
      METHODS: Following surgery for early breast cancer, patients underwent
      planning-CT scans in v_DIBH and ABC_DIBH. Patients were randomised to receive one
      technique for fractions 1-7 and the second technique for fractions 8-15 (40 Gy/15
      fractions total). Daily electronic portal imaging (EPI) was performed and matched
      to digitally-reconstructed radiographs. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) images were acquired 
      for 6/15 fractions and matched to planning-CT data. Population systematic (Sigma)
      and random errors (sigma) were estimated. Heart, left-anterior-descending
      coronary artery, and lung doses were calculated. Patient comfort, radiographer
      satisfaction and scanning/treatment times were recorded. Within-patient
      comparisons between the two techniques used the paired t-test or Wilcoxon
      signed-rank test. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were recruited. All completed
      treatment with both techniques. EPI-derived Sigma were </= 1.8mm (v_DIBH) and </=
      2.0mm (ABC_DIBH) and sigma </= 2.5mm (v_DIBH) and </= 2.2mm (ABC_DIBH) (all p
      non-significant). CBCT-derived Sigma were </= 3.9 mm (v_DIBH) and </= 4.9 mm
      (ABC_DIBH) and sigma </= 4.1mm (v_DIBH) and </= 3.8mm (ABC_DIBH). There was no
      significant difference between techniques in terms of normal-tissue doses (all p 
      non-significant). Patients and radiographers preferred v_DIBH (p=0.007, p=0.03,
      respectively). Scanning/treatment setup times were shorter for v_DIBH (p=0.02,
      p=0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: v_DIBH and ABC_DIBH are comparable in terms
      of positional reproducibility and normal tissue sparing. v_DIBH is preferred by
      patients and radiographers, takes less time to deliver, and is cheaper than
      ABC_DIBH.

TI  - Preassociation of IL-15 with IL-15R alpha-IgG1-Fc enhances its activity on
      proliferation of NK and CD8+/CD44high T cells and its antitumor action.
PG  - 2099-106
AB  - In the induction of an immune response, IL-15Ralpha on APCs transpresents IL-15
      to NK and CD8(+)/CD44(high) T cells that express the IL-2/15Rbeta and gammac
      subunits only. In this study, we show data mimicking this transpresentation by
      using IL-15 preassociated with a chimeric protein that is comprised of the
      extracellular domain of murine IL-15Ralpha and the Fc portion of human IgG1. When
      tested in vitro, IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc strongly increased the IL-15-mediated
      proliferation of murine NK and CD8(+)/CD44(high) T cells. The effect of
      IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc was dependent on the presence of both IgG1-Fc and
      IL-15Ralpha. When injected into mice, IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc enhanced the capacity
      of IL-15 to expand the number of NK and CD8(+)/CD44(high) T cells. The effect on 
      cell numbers in vivo also depended on Fc receptor binding because reduced
      expansion was observed in FcRgamma(-/-) mice. NK cells cultured in
      IL-15/IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc complex gained cytotoxic activity toward a number of
      NK-sensitive targets. When mice bearing the NK-sensitive syngeneic tumor B16 were
      treated, the presence of IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc increased the antitumor activity of 
      IL-15. Thus, a preassociation with IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc enhances the activities of
      IL-15 in vivo and in vitro that may be useful in the treatment of tumors.

TI  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors in a cohort of Chinese patients in Hong Kong.
PG  - 2223-8
AB  - AIM: To investigate the prevalence and clinical pattern of gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors (GISTs) in Hong Kong Chinese, and to assess the impact of
      introduction of CD117 on the disease incidence. METHODS: From the database of the
      Department of Pathology of Yan Chai Hospital, 47 patients, with GISTs from
      September 1995 to December 2003 were included in this study. Ten GISTs were
      diagnosed before the introduction of CD117. The clinical features, tumor
      characteristics, and treatment were analyzed. Factors predicting tumor related
      death or recurrence were studied with Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The
      patients included 26 males and 21 females, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD
      13.1, range 29-87 years). The estimated prevalence of GISTs was 13.4-15.6 per
      100,000 people, with an annual incidence of 1.68-1.96 per 100,000 people. The
      annual incidence of GISTs before and after the introduction of CD117 was 1.1 per 
      100,000 people and 2.1 per 100,000 people respectively. Stomach (34 patients,
      72.3%) was the most common location for the tumor, followed by the small
      intestine (8 patients, 17.0%), esophagus (2 patients, 4.3%), omentum (2 patients,
      4.3%) and colon (1 patient, 2.1%). Thirty-one patients (66%) had complete tumor
      resection. Eleven out of 16 deaths (23%) were tumor-related. The median survival 
      time was 26 mo. Five-year survival rate was 61.3%. The significant factors
      associated with tumor-related death or recurrence were incomplete resection,
      tumor size 5 cm or above, invasion to the adjacent organ or presence of
      metastasis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of GIST in Hong Kong is comparable to that 
      in the United States but lower than that in Finland. The true incidence of GISTs 
      could be underestimated before the introduction of CD117. Incomplete resection,
      tumor size 5 cm or above, invasion to the adjacent organ or presence of
      metastasis are factors predicting tumor-related death or recurrence.

TI  - Celastrol protects ischaemic myocardium through a heat shock response with
      up-regulation of haeme oxygenase-1.
PG  - 5265-79
LID - 10.1111/bph.12838 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Celastrol, a triterpene from plants, has been used in
      traditional oriental medicine to treat various diseases. Here, we investigated
      the cardioprotective effects of celastrol against ischaemia. EXPERIMENTAL
      APPROACH: Protective pathways induced by celastrol were investigated in hypoxic
      cultures of H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts and in a rat model of myocardial infarction,
      assessed with echocardiographic and histological analysis. KEY RESULTS: In H9c2
      cells, celastrol triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation within
      minutes, induced nuclear translocation of the transcription factor heat shock
      factor 1 (HSF1) resulting in a heat shock response (HSR) leading to increased
      expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine reduced 
      expression of HSP70 and HSP32 (haeme oxygenase-1, HO-1). Celastrol improved H9c2 
      survival under hypoxic stress, and functional analysis revealed HSF1 and HO-1 as 
      key effectors of the HSR, induced by celastrol, in promoting cytoprotection. In
      the rat ischaemic myocardium, celastrol treatment improved cardiac function and
      reduced adverse left ventricular remodelling at 14 days. Celastrol triggered
      expression of cardioprotective HO-1 and inhibited fibrosis and infarct size. In
      the peri-infarct area, celastrol reduced myofibroblast and macrophage
      infiltration, while attenuating up-regulation of TGF-beta and collagen genes.
      CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Celastrol treatment induced an HSR through
      activation of HSF1 with up-regulation of HO-1 as the key effector, promoting
      cardiomyocyte survival, reduction of injury and adverse remodelling with
      preservation of cardiac function. Celastrol may represent a novel potent
      pharmacological cardioprotective agent mimicking ischaemic conditioning that
      could have a valuable impact in the treatment of myocardial infarction.

      spatial patterns of gene expression.

AB  - Complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression underlie embryo
      differentiation, yet methods do not yet exist for the efficient genome-wide
      determination of spatial expression patterns during development. In situ imaging 
      of transcripts and proteins is the gold-standard, but it is difficult and time
      consuming to apply to an entire genome, even when highly automated. Sequencing,
      in contrast, is fast and genome-wide, but is generally applied to homogenized
      tissues, thereby discarding spatial information. To take advantage of the
      efficiency and comprehensiveness of sequencing while retaining spatial
      information, we cryosectioned individual blastoderm stage Drosophila melanogaster
      embryos along the anterior-posterior axis and developed methods to reliably
      sequence the mRNA isolated from each 25 microm slice. The spatial patterns of
      gene expression we infer closely match patterns previously determined by in situ 
      hybridization and microscopy. We applied this method to generate a genome-wide
      timecourse of spatial gene expression from shortly after fertilization through
      gastrulation. We identified numerous genes with spatial patterns that have not
      yet been described in the several ongoing systematic in situ based projects. This
      simple experiment demonstrates the potential for combining careful anatomical
      dissection with high-throughput sequencing to obtain spatially resolved gene
      expression on a genome-wide scale.

TI  - European Pain Federation position paper on appropriate opioid use in chronic pain
      management.
PG  - 3-19
LID - 10.1002/ejp.970 [doi]
AB  - Poorly controlled pain is a global public health issue. The personal, familial
      and societal costs are immeasurable. Only a minority of European patients have
      access to a comprehensive specialist pain clinic. More commonly the
      responsibility for chronic pain management and initiating opioid therapy rests
      with the primary care physician and other non-specialist opioid prescribers.
      There is much confusing and conflicting information available to non-specialist
      prescribers regarding opioid therapy and a great deal of unjustified fear is
      generated. Opioid therapy should only be initiated by competent clinicians as
      part of a multi-faceted treatment programme in circumstances where more simple
      measures have failed. Throughout, all patients must be kept under close clinical 
      surveillance. As with any other medical therapy, if the treatment fails to yield 
      the desired results and/or the patient is additionally burdened by an
      unacceptable level of adverse effects, the overall management strategy must be
      reviewed and revised. No responsible clinician will wish to pursue a failed
      treatment strategy or persist with an ineffective and burdensome treatment. In a 
      considered attempt to empower and inform non-specialist opioid prescribers, EFIC 
      convened a European group of experts, drawn from a diverse range of basic science
      and relevant clinical disciplines, to prepare a position paper on appropriate
      opioid use in chronic pain. The expert panel reviewed the available literature
      and harnessed the experience of many years of clinical practice to produce these 
      series of recommendations. Its success will be judged on the extent to which it
      contributes to an improved pain management experience for chronic pain patients
      across Europe. SIGNIFICANCE: This position paper provides expert recommendations 
      for primary care physicians and other non- specialist healthcare professionals in
      Europe, particularly those who do not have ready access to specialists in pain
      medicine, on the safe and appropriate use of opioid medications as part of a
      multi-faceted approach to pain management, in properly selected and supervised
      patients.

AB  - General anesthetics achieve behavioral unresponsiveness via a mechanism that is
      incompletely understood. The study of genetic model systems such as the fruit fly
      Drosophila melanogaster is crucial to advancing our understanding of how
      anesthetic drugs render animals unresponsive. Previous studies have shown that
      wild-type control strains differ significantly in their sensitivity to general
      anesthetics, which potentially introduces confounding factors for comparing
      genetic mutations placed on these wild-type backgrounds. Here, we examined a
      variety of behavioral and electrophysiological endpoints in Drosophila, in both
      adult and larval animals. We characterized these endpoints in 3 commonly used fly
      strains: wild-type Canton Special (CS), and 2 commonly used white-eyed strains,
      isoCJ1 and w(1118). We found that CS and isoCJ1 show remarkably similar
      sensitivity to isoflurane across a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological
      endpoints. In contrast, w(1118) is resistant to isoflurane compared to the other 
      2 strains at both the adult and larval stages. This resistance is however not
      reflected at the level of neurotransmitter release at the larval neuromuscular
      junction (NMJ). This suggests that the w(1118) strain harbors another mutation
      that produces isoflurane resistance, by acting on an arousal pathway that is most
      likely preserved between larval and adult brains. This mutation probably also
      affects sleep, as marked differences between isoCJ1 and w(1118) have also
      recently been found for behavioral responsiveness and sleep intensity measures.

      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 439-45
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0000000000000026 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a prevalent condition in chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) very often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed.
      Electrocardiography (ECG) is an easily accessible LVH diagnostic tool. We
      evaluated the usefulness of commonly applied ECG criteria for LVH diagnosis in
      CKD patients. METHODS: Cross-sectional evaluation of 253 nondialysis-dependent
      CKD stages 3-5 patients (61 [53-67] years; 65% men). Left ventricular mass (LVM) 
      was assessed by echocardiography (ECHO). ECG was performed to assess Cornell
      voltage and Sokolow-Lyon voltage and their products (Cornell product and
      Sokolow-Lyon product, respectively). RESULTS: The prevalence of LVH ranged from
      72 to 89% depending on ECHO criteria used. Cornell product showed the best
      correlation with ECHO-estimated LVM (rho = 0.41; P <0.001). Across sex-specific
      tertiles of ECHO-LVM, ECG criteria increased and patients were more often
      hypertensive, obese, fluid overloaded, inflamed, and with higher albuminuria.
      Cornell product showed the strongest association with ECHO-LVM in crude and
      adjusted regression models, and the higher predictive performance for all the
      ECHO-based LVH definitions. However, when applying literature-based ECG cut-offs 
      for LVH diagnosis, Sokolow-Lyon product showed a higher specificity. The
      agreement between ECG criteria cut-offs and ECHO-based definitions of LVH was in 
      general poor, and the number of patients reclassified correctly by ECHO ranged
      from 77 to 94%. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ECG alone is a weak indicator
      of LVH, and do not support its routine use as a unique tool in the screening of
      LVH in CKD patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to
      try establishing adequate cut-offs for LVH diagnosis in this population.

TI  - Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in United Nations peacekeepers: an
      examination of factor structure in peacekeepers with and without chronic pain.
PG  - 26-37
AB  - Recent factor analytic investigations of post-traumatic stress disorder in
      military veterans suggest that symptoms are best described by either a
      hierarchical 2-factor model or a 4-factor inter-correlated model. Other recent
      evidence suggests that post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain are
      intricately related; however, the nature of this relationship is not well
      understood. Factor analysis provides one method for clarifying this relationship.
      In study 1, we compared competing models of post-traumatic stress disorder
      symptom structure in a sample of 400 male United Nations peacekeepers using
      confirmatory factor analysis. Results indicated that both the hierarchical
      2-factor and the 4-factor inter-correlated models provided good fit to the data. 
      In study 2, the reliability of these models was assessed in 427 male United
      Nations peacekeepers with chronic back pain and 341 without. Group comparisons of
      the confirmatory factor analysis results revealed that the structure of the
      hierarchical 2-factor and 4-factor inter-correlated models both provided good fit
      to the data in both the chronic back pain and the group without. However, the
      structure of the models for the group with chronic back pain group differed in
      significant ways from that of the group without chronic back pain. Post-traumatic
      stress disorder symptoms in military veterans can be adequately conceptualized
      using either a hierarchical 2-factor or 4-factor inter-correlated model. Chronic 
      pain has a minimal influence on overall factor structure. The hierarchical
      2-factor model, while parsimonious, does not provide the degree of symptom detail
      provided by the 4-factor inter-correlated model. Implications for
      conceptualization of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms for patients with
      chronic back pain and significant post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology
      are discussed.

AB  - Synaptic remodeling has been postulated as a mechanism underlying synaptic
      plasticity and cell adhesion molecules are thought to contribute to this process.
      We examined the role of nectin-1 ectodomain shedding on synaptogenesis in
      cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Nectins are Ca(2+) -independent
      immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules, involved in cell-cell adherens junctions.
      Herein, we show that the processing of nectin-1 occurs by multiple
      endoproteolytic steps both in vivo and in vitro. We identified regions containing
      two distinct cleavage sites within the ectodomain of nectin-1. By alanine
      scanning mutagenesis, two point mutations that disrupt nectin-1 ectodomain
      cleavage events were identified. Expression of these mutants significantly alters
      the density of dendritic spines. These findings suggest that ectodomain shedding 
      of nectin-1 regulates dendritic spine density and related synaptic functions.

TI  - Standardization of measuring power output during wheelchair propulsion on a
      treadmill Pitfalls in a multi-center study.
PG  - 604-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a multi-center study the power output of wheelchair propulsion,
      attained by a wheelchair drag test, differed among rehabilitation centers. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate what causes the differences in drag
      force among centers. METHODS: A set of standardized drag tests was performed
      while systematically varying the calibration set of the force transducer, the
      tester and the wheelchair. In addition, the actual calibrated velocity and slope 
      of the treadmill were measured. RESULTS: Difference in drag force among centers
      was due to variation in wheelchair set-up and differences in the slopes between
      treadmills. The drag force was not significantly different when different testers
      performed the test. The belt velocity in almost all centers was lower than the
      manufacturer specified (assumed) velocity. CONCLUSION: The drag test appeared a
      robust test as far as the tester is considered. Variation in wheelchairs and
      differences in the actual slopes of the treadmills affected the imposed drag
      force. The assumed velocity of the treadmill led to an overestimation of the
      power output. The power output in the multi-center study should be recalculated
      using the measured velocities and the wheelchair set-up should be more
      standardized.

AB  - The present study was designed to replicate previous findings reporting a
      significant association between the rs548294 polymorphism at the glutamate
      receptor subunit GluR1 gene (GRIA1) and migraine without aura, either as a single
      marker or in haplotype combination with rs2195450. In addition, the role of GRIA1
      polymorphisms and haplotypes was evaluated in migraine patients without aura as
      predictive factors for consistency in headache response to triptans. Analysis of 
      rs548294 and rs2195450 polymorphisms of GRIA1 was conducted by Real-time PCR
      allelic discrimination assay in 186 migraine patients without aura and 312
      healthy controls, respectively. In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for 
      gender and age, genotype and haplotype frequencies for the two polymorphisms did 
      not significantly differ between migraine patients without aura and controls. In 
      addition, no evidence of association was found between GRIA1
      polymorphisms/haplotypes and consistent response to triptans. This study failed
      to replicate previously reported association between GRIA1 rs548294 and migraine 
      without aura, either as single marker or when analyzed in haplotype combination
      with rs2195450. In addition, no evidence was found for a relevant role of GRIA1
      polymorphisms and haplotypes as modulating factors of headache response to
      triptans.

TI  - Sequence-based SNP genotyping in durum wheat.
PG  - 809-17
LID - 10.1111/pbi.12072 [doi]
AB  - Marker development for marker-assisted selection in plant breeding is
      increasingly based on next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, marker
      development in crops with highly repetitive, complex genomes is still
      challenging. Here we applied sequence-based genotyping (SBG), which couples
      AFLP(R)-based complexity reduction to NGS, for de novo single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNP) marker discovery in and genotyping of a biparental durum
      wheat population. We identified 9983 putative SNPs in 6372 contigs between the
      two parents and used these SNPs for genotyping 91 recombinant inbred lines
      (RILs). Excluding redundant information from multiple SNPs per contig, 2606 (41%)
      markers were used for integration in a pre-existing framework map, resulting in
      the integration of 2365 markers over 2607 cM. Of the 2606 markers available for
      mapping, 91% were integrated in the pre-existing map, containing 708 SSRs, DArT
      markers, and SNPs from CRoPS technology, with a map-size increase of 492 cM
      (23%). These results demonstrate the high quality of the discovered SNP markers. 
      With this methodology, it was possible to saturate the map at a final marker
      density of 0.8 cM/marker. Looking at the binned marker distribution (Figure 2),
      63 of the 268 10-cM bins contained only SBG markers, showing that these markers
      are filling in gaps in the framework map. As to the markers that could not be
      used for mapping, the main reason was the low sequencing coverage used for
      genotyping. We conclude that SBG is a valuable tool for efficient,
      high-throughput and high-quality marker discovery and genotyping for complex
      genomes such as that of durum wheat.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging for pediatric musculoskeletal
      disorders.
PG  - 781-8
AB  - Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a powerful tool that has recently been
      applied to evaluate several pediatric musculoskeletal disorders. DWI probes
      abnormalities of tissue structure by detecting microscopic changes in water
      mobility that develop when disease alters the organization of normal tissue. DWI 
      provides tissue characterization at a cellular level beyond what is available
      with other imaging techniques, and can sometimes identify pathology before gross 
      anatomic alterations manifest. These features of early detection and tissue
      characterization make DWI particularly appealing for probing diseases that affect
      the musculoskeletal system. This article focuses on the current and future
      applications of DWI in the musculoskeletal system, with particular attention paid
      to pediatric disorders. Although most of the applications are experimental, we
      have emphasized the current state of knowledge and the main research questions
      that need to be investigated.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the
      polymorphisms of fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), fatty acid desaturase 2
      (FADS2), and elongation of very long-chain fatty acids-like 2 (ELOVL2) and acute 
      coronary syndrome (ACS) in Chinese Han population. Therefore, we selected three
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these candidate genes and genotyped
      them using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 249 ACS
      patients and 240 non-ACS subjects, as were Han Chinese ancestry. The results
      showed that rs174556 in the FADS1 gene is found to be in allelic association (P =
      0.003 ) and genotypic association (P = 0.036) with ACS. The frequencies of
      rs174556 minor allele (T) in case group were obviously higher than in control
      group. The trans-phase gene-gene interaction analysis showed that the combined
      genotype of rs174556 (T/T) and rs3756963 (T/T) was associated with ACS (P =
      0.031). And the results suggest that, for rs174556 C>T, the CT/TT genotypes were 
      more likely to lead in ACS in subjects with hypertension after correction of all 
      risk factors (OR = 4.236, 95% CI, 2.216-7.126). These findings suggest that the
      polymorphisms of rs174556 in the FADS1 gene are very likely to be associated with
      ACS in Chinese Han population, especially in subjects with hypertension.

TI  - Presence of S100A9-positive inflammatory cells in cancer tissues correlates with 
      an early stage cancer and a better prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.
PG  - 316
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: S100A9 was originally discovered as a factor secreted by inflammatory
      cells. Recently, S100A9 was found to be associated with several human
      malignancies. The purpose of this study is to investigate S100A9 expression in
      gastric cancer and explore its role in cancer progression. METHODS: S100A9
      expression in gastric tissue samples from 177 gastric cancer patients was
      assessed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of its dimerization partner
      S100A8 and the S100A8/A9 heterodimer were also assessed by the same method. The
      effect of exogenous S100A9 on motility of gastric cancer cells AGS and BGC-823
      was then investigated. RESULTS: S100A9 was specifically expressed by inflammatory
      cells such as macrophages and neutrophils in human gastric cancer and gastritis
      tissues. Statistical analysis showed that a high S100A9 cell count (> = 200) per 
      200x magnification microscopic field in cancer tissues was predictive of early
      stage gastric cancer. High S100A9-positive cell count was negatively correlated
      with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.009) and tumor invasion (P = 0.011). S100A9 was
      identified as an independent prognostic predictor of overall survival of patients
      with gastric cancer (P = 0.04). Patients with high S100A9 cell count were with
      favorable prognosis (P = 0.021). Further investigation found that S100A8
      distribution in human gastric cancer tissues was similar to S100A9. However, the 
      number of S100A8-positive cells did not positively correlate with patient
      survival. The inflammatory cells infiltrating cancer were S100A8/A9 negative,
      while those in gastritis were positive. Furthermore, exogenous S100A9 protein
      inhibited migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results suggested S100A9-positive inflammatory cells in gastric cancer tissues
      are associated with early stage of gastric cancer and good prognosis.

TI  - Plant sulfate assimilation genes: redundancy versus specialization.
PG  - 1769-80
LID - 10.1007/s00299-009-0793-0 [doi]
AB  - Sulfur is an essential nutrient present in the amino acids cysteine and
      methionine, co-enzymes and vitamins. Plants and many microorganisms are able to
      utilize inorganic sulfate and assimilate it into these compounds. Sulfate
      assimilation in plants has been extensively studied because of the many functions
      of sulfur in plant metabolism and stress defense. The pathway is highly regulated
      in a demand-driven manner. A characteristic feature of this pathway is that most 
      of its components are encoded by small multigene families. This may not be
      surprising, as several steps of sulfate assimilation occur in multiple cellular
      compartments, but the composition of the gene families is more complex than
      simply organellar versus cytosolic forms. Recently, several of these gene
      families have been investigated in a systematic manner utilizing Arabidopsis
      reverse genetics tools. In this review, we will assess how far the individual
      isoforms of sulfate assimilation enzymes possess specific functions and what
      level of genetic redundancy is retained. We will also compare the genomic
      organization of sulfate assimilation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with
      other plant species to find common and species-specific features of the pathway.

TI  - Biochemical responses of the Protaetia brevitarsis Lewis larvae to subchronic
      copper exposure.
PG  - 18570-18578
LID - 10.1007/s11356-018-2031-1 [doi]
AB  - Copper (Cu) is one of the most commonly detected heavy metals in livestock manure
      pollution. Protaetia brevitarsis Lewis larvae are widely used in the
      decomposition of livestock manure. During decomposition, heavy metals in
      livestock manure can accumulate in P. brevitarsis larvae and affect normal growth
      and reproduction. Therefore, this research focused on characterizing the toxic
      effects of Cu to P. brevitarsis Lewis larvae. Larvae were exposed to Cu
      concentrations of 0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg kg(-1) in edible fungi residue for
      7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Results showed that the soluble protein content was
      markedly increased in 200 and 400 mg kg(-1) treatment groups on day 28. Compared 
      to the control group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase
      (GST) activities were significantly stimulated on day 7 and then decreased as
      exposure length was increased (e.g., after 14, 21, and 28 days). Catalase (CAT)
      activity was also significantly increased after 7 days of exposure.
      Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were markedly increased in the 100, 200, and 400 mg 
      kg(-1) treatment groups on day 7. However, as time and Cu concentration were
      increased, MDA levels gradually decreased. These results indicate that Cu has
      biochemical effects on P. brevitarsis Lewis larvae, and both time and dose affect
      this biochemical response.

PG  - 127-132
LID - 10.1007/s10877-017-9997-y [doi]
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that the environmental noise generated by a forced-air
      warming system reduces the monitoring accuracy of acoustic respiration rate
      (RRa). Noise levels were adjusted to 45-55, 56-65, 66-75, and 76-85 dB. Healthy
      participants breathed at set respiration rates (RRset) of 6, 12, and 30/min.
      Under each noise level at each RRset, the respiration rates by manual counting
      (RRm) and RRa were recorded. Any appearance of the alarm display on the RRa
      monitor was also recorded. Each RRm of all participants agreed with each RRset at
      each noise level. At 45-55 dB noise, the RRa of 13, 17, and 17 participants
      agreed with RRset of 6, 12, and 30/min, respectively. The RRa of 14, 17, and 16
      participants at 56-65 dB noise, agreed with RRset of 6, 12, and 30/min,
      respectively. At 66-75 dB noise, the RRa of 9, 15, and 16 participants agreed
      with RRset of 6, 12, and 30/min, respectively. The RRa of one, nine, and nine
      participants at 76-85 dB noise agreed with RRset of 6, 12, and 30/min,
      respectively, which was significantly less than the other noise levels (P <
      0.05). Overall, 72.9% of alarm displays highlighted incorrect values of RRa. In a
      noisy situation involving the operation of a forced-air warming system, the
      acoustic respiration monitoring should be used carefully especially in patients
      with a low respiration rate.

TI  - The growing teratoma syndrome after subtotal resection of an intracranial
      nongerminomatous germ cell tumor in an adult: case report.
PG  - 188
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We report a rare complication after resection of a
      recurrent intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumor in an adult. The growing 
      teratoma syndrome, as originally described with pediatric germ cell neoplasms,
      represents tumor recurrence, often cystic, that sometimes is observed after
      partial response to multimodality therapy and despite decreasing tumor serum
      markers. The enlarging tumor consists of elements of a mature teratoma that
      presumably are refractory to chemotherapy or radiation. To our knowledge, this is
      only the third case of the growing teratoma syndrome in an adult patient with
      nongerminomatous germ cell tumor. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old man had
      signs of recurrent obstructive hydrocephalus 6 months after multimodality
      treatment of a diencephalic yolk sac tumor and endoscopic third ventriculostomy. 
      Imaging studies revealed large multilocular cystic masses originating from the
      tumor bed and partially obstructing the ventriculostomy. INTERVENTION: Near total
      tumor resection and fenestration was performed. Histopathological analysis
      demonstrated a mature teratoma. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection, if feasible, is
      the treatment of choice for the growing teratoma syndrome to establish the
      correct diagnosis and prevent complications.

PG  - 7-11
AB  - In both thromboembolic disease and pulmonary hypertension, 2010 has been a
      prodigious year for interesting publications. Some data have helped to elucidate 
      the factors associated with a greater risk of thromboembolic disease, such as
      long journeys and certain polymorphisms. New recommendations on diagnosis have
      been made, giving a greater role to computed tomography angiography. Magnetic
      resonance imaging is also gaining ground. More accurate risk evaluation is one of
      the objectives of the new guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, which
      substitute some terms such as massive or submassive for high- and low-risk.
      Maintaining anticoagulation indefinitely in idiopathic pulmonary thromboembolism 
      is recommended. Evidence on the efficacy of new drugs such as rivaroxaban,
      dabigatran and indraparinux is beginning to appear. In pulmonary hypertension,
      smoking seems to play a role as a risk factor. Some registries indicate that new 
      treatments have not improved survival. Greater knowledge has been gained of the
      role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of the disease and a Spanish study
      supports the role of the 6-minute walk test in patient evaluation. Some drugs are
      highlighted in the literature. Imatinib is promising but probably only in some
      patients. Riociguat provides good results and inhaled treprostinil has emerged as
      a new option.

TI  - The association between price of regular-grade gasoline and injury and mortality 
      rates among occupants involved in motorcycle- and automobile-related motor
      vehicle collisions.
PG  - 1075-9
LID - 10.1016/j.aap.2009.06.009 [doi]
AB  - Motorcyclists have been reported to be more likely to die in a motor vehicle
      collision (MVC) than automobile occupants. With the recent increase in the pump
      price of gasoline, it has been reported that people are switching to motorcycles 
      as main modes of transportation. This study evaluated the association between
      motor vehicle collision-related injury and mortality rates and increases in
      gasoline prices for occupants of automobiles and riders of motorcycles. There
      were an estimated 1,270,512 motorcycle MVC and 238,390,853 automobile MVC
      involved occupants in the U.S. from 1992 to 2007. Higher gasoline prices were
      associated with increased motorcycle-related injuries and deaths; however, this
      association no longer remained after accounting for changes in the number of
      registered vehicles. The current study observed that, while the number of
      injuries and fatalities in motorcycle-related MVCs increase with increasing
      gasoline price, rates remained largely unchanged. This suggests that the observed
      increase in motorcycle-related injuries and fatalities with increasing gasoline
      price is more a factor of the number of motorcycles on the road rather than
      operator characteristics.

TI  - Assessing the cost-effectiveness of drug and lifestyle intervention following
      opportunistic screening for pre-diabetes in primary care.
PG  - 875-81
LID - 10.1007/s00125-010-1661-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a
      screening programme for pre-diabetes, which was followed up by treatment with
      pharmaceutical interventions (acarbose, metformin, orlistat) or lifestyle
      interventions (diet, exercise, diet and exercise) in order to prevent or slow the
      onset of diabetes in those at high risk. METHODS: To approximate the experience
      of individuals with pre-diabetes in the Australian population, we used a
      microsimulation approach, following patient progression through diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease and renal failure. The model compares costs and
      disability-adjusted life years lived in people identified through an
      opportunistic screening programme for each intervention compared with a 'do
      nothing' scenario, which is representative of current practice. It is assumed
      that the effect of a lifestyle change will decay by 10% per year, while the
      effect of a pharmaceutical intervention remains constant throughout use. RESULTS:
      The most cost-effective intervention options are diet and exercise combined, with
      a cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD 22,500 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY)
      averted, and metformin with a cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD 21,500 per DALY
      averted. The incremental addition of one intervention to the other is not
      cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Screening for pre-diabetes followed
      by diet and exercise, or metformin treatment is cost-effective and should be
      considered for incorporation into current practice. The number of dietitians and 
      exercise physiologists needed to deliver such lifestyle change interventions will
      need to be increased to appropriately support the intervention.

AB  - Inorganic arsenic (As) is a known pollutant including two chemical forms
      (arsenite (As III) and arsenate (As V)), in marine and coastal environment.
      Marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is an important environmental monitoring 
      species around the world. In this study, we focused on valence-specific responses
      of As in juvenile mussel M. galloprovincialis using a combined proteomic and
      metabolomic approach. Metabolic responses indicated that As (III) mainly caused
      disturbance in osmotic regulation in juvenile mussels. As (V) caused disturbances
      in both osmotic regulation and energy metabolism marked by different metabolic
      responses, including betaine, taurine, glucose and glycogen. Proteomic responses 
      exhibited that As (III) had a significant negative effect on cytoskeleton and
      cell structure (actin and collagen alpha-6(VI) chain). As (V) affected some key
      enzymes involved in energy metabolism (cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, cMDH) and 
      cell development (ornithine aminotransferase and astacin). Overall, all these
      results confirmed the valence-specific responses in juvenile mussels to As
      exposures. These findings demonstrate that a combined metabolomic and proteomic
      approach could provide an important insight into the toxicological effects of
      environmental pollutants in organisms.

TI  - Like a shadow--on becoming a stroke victim's relative.
PG  - 48-55
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2006.00494.x [doi]
AB  - Stroke is the third leading cause of death and disability in the western world.
      Given the ageing population in Sweden, the number of people suffering from stroke
      is likely to increase in the future. Stroke alters the lives of both patients and
      their relatives. Few studies have explored first time affected relatives'
      experiences of suddenly becoming a relative to a stroke victim, before the
      relatives decide whether or not to become informal carers. The aim of this study 
      was to illuminate the meaning of going from being just a relative to gradually
      becoming a relative to a stroke victim from the time of the stroke event and the 
      first weeks on. Sixteen relatives were interviewed about their experiences
      regarding what it was like to become a relative of a stroke victim from the time 
      of the onset of the illness to the day of the interview. Using a phenomenological
      hermeneutic method, two essential main themes emerged to describe the relatives' 
      experience: (i) being in chaos and (ii) searching for order in chaos. The
      findings reveal that relatives reach a 'turning point'. The 'turning point'
      arises when the relatives stay close to the stroke victim, get aware of their own
      strength and actively seek out caregivers to restore order and stability to the
      chaotic situation they are in. At the 'turning point', the relatives start their 
      journey to restore order and stability of the chaotic life situation. Caregivers 
      need to pay more attention and be more sensitive to relatives to increase their
      possibilities of restoring order and stability in their lives. The results
      contribute to facilitating the caregivers' work by showing that the time is ripe 
      for initiating pedagogical work when the relatives start to mobilise themselves.

LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07369-6 [doi]
AB  - In typical metallic tunnel junctions, the tunneling events occur on a femtosecond
      timescale. An estimation of this time requires current measurements at optical
      frequencies and remains challenging. However, it has been known for more than 40 
      years that as soon as the bias voltage exceeds one volt, the junction emits
      infrared radiation as an electrically driven optical antenna. We demonstrate here
      that the photon emission results from the fluctuations of the current inside the 
      tunneling barrier. Photon detection is then equivalent to a measurement of the
      current fluctuations at optical frequencies, allowing to probe the tunneling
      time. Based on this idea, we perform optical spectroscopy and electronic current 
      fluctuation measurements in the far from equilibrium regime. Our experimental
      data are in very good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the
      Landauer Buttiker scattering formalism. By combining the optics and the
      electronics, we directly estimate the so-called traversal time.

TI  - In vivo cell wall loosening by hydroxyl radicals during cress seed germination
      and elongation growth.
PG  - 1855-65
LID - 10.1104/pp.109.139204 [doi]
AB  - Loosening of cell walls is an important developmental process in key stages of
      the plant life cycle, including seed germination, elongation growth, and fruit
      ripening. Here, we report direct in vivo evidence for hydroxyl radical
      ((*)OH)-mediated cell wall loosening during plant seed germination and seedling
      growth. We used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that (*)OH
      is generated in the cell wall during radicle elongation and weakening of the
      endosperm of cress (Lepidium sativum; Brassicaceae) seeds. Endosperm weakening
      precedes radicle emergence, as demonstrated by direct biomechanical measurements.
      By (3)H fingerprinting, we showed that wall polysaccharides are oxidized in vivo 
      by the developmentally regulated action of apoplastic (*)OH in radicles and
      endosperm caps: the production and action of (*)OH increased during endosperm
      weakening and radicle elongation and were inhibited by the germination-inhibiting
      hormone abscisic acid. Both effects were reversed by gibberellin. Distinct and
      tissue-specific target sites of (*)OH attack on polysaccharides were evident. In 
      vivo (*)OH attack on cell wall polysaccharides were evident not only in
      germinating seeds but also in elongating maize (Zea mays; Poaceae) seedling
      coleoptiles. We conclude that plant cell wall loosening by (*)OH is a controlled 
      action of this type of reactive oxygen species.

TI  - Multi-grams scale purification of xanthanolides from Xanthium macrocarpum.
      Centrifugal partition chromatography versus silica gel chromatography.
PG  - 14-9
AB  - Plants of the Asteraceae family are known as a source of sesquiterpene lactones
      with interesting biological activities. The purification of several xanthanolides
      (xanthathin, 4-epi-xanthanol and 4-epi-isoxanthanol) was realized in one step,
      directly from the crude chloroformic extract of the leaves of X. macrocarpum by
      silica gel chromatography and for the first time by liquid/liquid chromatography 
      (counter-current chromatography/centrifugal partition chromatography), using a
      FCPC 5L (Fast centrifugal partition chromatograph, Kromaton Technologies, Angers,
      France). Recovery, purity of xanthathin and solvent consumption were improved
      with the liquid/liquid chromatography compared to solid/liquid chromatography.

TI  - Serum Vitamin D Levels and Polycystic Ovary syndrome: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 4555-77
LID - 10.3390/nu7064555 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is common in women with and without polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) and may be associated with metabolic and endocrine disorders in
      PCOS. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the associations of serum
      vitamin D levels with metabolic and endocrine dysregulations in women with PCOS, 
      and to determine effects of vitamin D supplementation on metabolic and hormonal
      functions in PCOS patients. The literature search was undertaken through five
      databases until 16 January 2015 for both observational and experimental studies
      concerning relationships between vitamin D and PCOS. A total of 366 citations
      were identified, of which 30 were selected (n = 3182). We found that lower serum 
      vitamin D levels were related to metabolic and hormonal disorders in women with
      PCOS. Specifically, PCOS patients with VDD were more likely to have dysglycemia
      (e.g., increased levels of fasting glucose and homeostatic model
      assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR)) compared to those without VDD.
      This meta-analysis found no evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduced or
      mitigated metabolic and hormonal dysregulations in PCOS. VDD may be a comorbid
      manifestation of PCOS or a minor pathway in PCOS associated metabolic and
      hormonal dysregulation. Future prospective observational studies and randomized
      controlled trials with repeated VDD assessment and better characterization of
      PCOS disease severity at enrollment are needed to clarify whether VDD is a
      co-determinant of hormonal and metabolic dysregulations in PCOS, represents a
      consequence of hormonal and metabolic dysregulations in PCOS or both.

TI  - Determinants of image quality of rotational angiography for on-line assessment of
      frame geometry after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
PG  - 1021-9
LID - 10.1007/s10554-016-0889-x [doi]
AB  - To study the determinants of image quality of rotational angiography using
      dedicated research prototype software for motion compensation without rapid
      ventricular pacing after the implantation of four commercially available
      catheter-based valves. Prospective observational study including 179 consecutive 
      patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with either
      the Medtronic CoreValve (MCS), Edward-SAPIEN Valve (ESV), Boston Sadra Lotus
      (BSL) or Saint-Jude Portico Valve (SJP) in whom rotational angiography (R-angio) 
      with motion compensation 3D image reconstruction was performed. Image quality was
      evaluated from grade 1 (excellent image quality) to grade 5 (strongly degraded). 
      Distinction was made between good (grades 1, 2) and poor image quality (grades
      3-5). Clinical (gender, body mass index, Agatston score, heart rate and rhythm,
      artifacts), procedural (valve type) and technical variables (isocentricity) were 
      related with the image quality assessment. Image quality was good in 128 (72 %)
      and poor in 51 (28 %) patients. By univariable analysis only valve type (BSL) and
      the presence of an artefact negatively affected image quality. By multivariate
      analysis (in which BMI was forced into the model) BSL valve (Odds 3.5, 95 % CI
      [1.3-9.6], p = 0.02), presence of an artifact (Odds 2.5, 95 % CI [1.2-5.4], p =
      0.02) and BMI (Odds 1.1, 95 % CI [1.0-1.2], p = 0.04) were independent predictors
      of poor image quality. Rotational angiography with motion compensation 3D image
      reconstruction using a dedicated research prototype software offers good image
      quality for the evaluation of frame geometry after TAVI in the majority of
      patients. Valve type, presence of artifacts and higher BMI negatively affect
      image quality.

AB  - Dicke superradiance from a two-section violet GaN/InGaN semiconductor laser diode
      is demonstrated for the first time. In the superradiance regime, optical pulses
      with peak powers in excess of 2.8 W and durations as short as 1.4 ps are
      generated at repetition rates of up to 10 MHz at the emission wavelength of 408
      nm. The properties of superradiant pulse generation from these GaN/InGaN laser
      diodes are very similar to those reported for infrared AlGaAs/GaAs laser diodes.

AB  - Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is not only one of the leading causes of
      cognitive impairment but also an important contributory factor in Alzheimer's
      disease. SVD and related white matter changes are common in the elderly, but the 
      underlying pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. The end-stage pathology of SVD
      often involves replacement of vascular smooth muscle cells with collagenous or
      other nontensile fibrillary material. Recent studies on hereditary SVD have
      revealed a close relationship between small vessel pathology and disruption of
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily signaling. TGF-beta
      superfamily members, such as TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic proteins, are
      multifunctional proteins that regulate production of extracellular matrix
      proteins, which in turn control the bioavailability of TGF-beta superfamily
      members and modulate their signaling activities. This article reviews hereditary 
      disorders with small vessel pathology and their relation to TGF-beta superfamily 
      signaling.

TI  - Comparison of U2OS and Huh-7 cells for identifying host factors that affect
      hepatitis C virus RNA replication.
PG  - 2238-48
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.022210-0 [doi]
AB  - Host cell factors are critical to all stages of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life 
      cycle. While many cellular proteins that regulate HCV genome synthesis have been 
      identified, the mechanisms engaged in this process are incompletely understood.
      To identify novel cellular proteins involved in HCV RNA replication, we screened 
      a library of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting 299 cellular factors,
      which principally function in RNA interactions. For the screen, a robust system
      was established using two cell lines (derived from Huh-7 and U2OS cells) that
      replicated tricistronic subgenomic replicons (SGRs). We found that the U2OS cell 
      line gave lower levels of intracellular HCV RNA replication compared with Huh-7
      cells and was more readily transfected by siRNAs. Consequently, increased gene
      silencing and greater effects on HCV replication were observed in the U2OS cell
      line. Thus, U2OS cells provided a suitable and more sensitive alternative to
      Huh-7 cells for siRNA studies on HCV RNA replication. From the screen, several
      cellular proteins that enhanced and suppressed HCV RNA replication were
      identified. One of the genes found to downregulate viral RNA synthesis, ISG15, is
      expressed in response to alpha interferon and may therefore partly contribute to 
      the clearance of virus from infected individuals. A second gene that inhibited
      HCV RNA levels was the 5'-3' exoRNase XRN1, which suggested a role for cellular
      RNA degradation pathways in modulating the abundance of viral genomes. Therefore,
      this study provides an important framework for future detailed analyses of these 
      and other cellular proteins.

AB  - PURPOSE: The present study aimed to determine the effect of demographic
      characteristics, occupation, anthropometric indices, and leisure-time physical
      activity levels on coronary risk and health-related quality of life among
      military police officers from the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. METHODS: The
      sample included 165 military police officers who fulfilled the study's inclusion 
      criteria. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Short Form
      Health Survey were used, in addition to a spreadsheet of socio-demographic,
      occupational and anthropometric data. Statistical analyses were performed using
      descriptive analysis followed by Spearman Correlation and multiple linear
      regression analysis using the backward method. RESULTS: The waist-to-height ratio
      was identified as a risk factor low health-related quality of life. In addition, 
      the conicity index, fat percentage, years of service in the military police,
      minutes of work per day and leisure-time physical activity levels were identified
      as risk factors for coronary disease among police officers. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings suggest that the Military Police Department should adopt an
      institutional policy that allows police officers to practice regular physical
      activity in order to maintain and improve their physical fitness, health, job
      performance, and quality of life.

AB  - Erectile dysfunction (ED) due to diabetes mellitus remains difficult to treat
      medically despite advances in pharmacotherapeutic approaches in the field. This
      unmet need has resulted in a recent re-focus on the pathophysiology, in order to 
      understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to ED in diabetes.
      Diabetes-induced ED is often resistant to PDE5 inhibitor treatment, thus there is
      a need to discover targets that may lead to novel approaches for a successful
      treatment. The aim of this brief review is to update the reader in some of the
      latest development on that front, with a particular focus on the role of impaired
      neuronal blood flow and the formation of advanced glycation endproducts.

TI  - Mathematical modeling of influenza A virus dynamics within swine farms and the
      effects of vaccination.
PG  - e106177
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106177 [doi]
AB  - Influenza A virus infections are widespread in swine herds across the world.
      Influenza negatively affects swine health and production, and represents a
      significant threat to public health due to the risk of zoonotic infections. Swine
      herds can act as reservoirs for potentially pandemic influenza strains. In this
      study, we develop mathematical models based on experimental data, representing
      typical breeding and wean-to-finish swine farms. These models are used to explore
      and describe the dynamics of influenza infection at the farm level, which are at 
      present not well understood. In addition, we use the models to assess the
      effectiveness of vaccination strategies currently employed by swine producers,
      testing both homologous and heterologous vaccines. An important finding is that
      following an influenza outbreak in a breeding herd, our model predicts a
      persistently high level of infectious piglets. Sensitivity analysis indicates
      that this finding is robust to changes in both transmission rates and farm size. 
      Vaccination does not eliminate influenza throughout the breeding farm population.
      In the wean-to-finish herd, influenza infection may persist in the population
      only if recovered individuals become susceptible to infection again. A homologous
      vaccine administered to the entire wean-to-finish population after the loss of
      maternal antibodies eliminates influenza, but a vaccine that only induces partial
      protection (heterologous vaccine) has little effect on influenza infection
      levels. Our results have important implications for the control of influenza in
      swine herds, which is crucial in order to reduce both losses for swine producers 
      and the risk to public health.

TI  - Antidepressants reverse short-photoperiod-induced, forced swim test
      depression-like behavior in the diurnal fat sand rat: further support for the
      utilization of diurnal rodents for modeling affective disorders.
PG  - 191-6
LID - 10.1159/000321805 [doi]
AB  - Recent findings demonstrate strong links between abnormalities in circadian
      rhythms and sleep and the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of major
      affective disorders. Further exploration of these interactions requires the
      development, identification and utilization of good and predictive animal models.
      The biology and behavior related to circadian rhythms are significantly different
      in diurnal and nocturnal rodents. Accordingly, it is possible that exploring the 
      interactions between these mechanisms and affective change in diurnal animals may
      be advantageous. Recent studies demonstrate that diurnal fat sand rats and Nile
      grass rats show depression-like behavior when maintained under short-photoperiod 
      (SP) conditions compared with animals maintained under neutral photoperiod (NP)
      conditions. Moreover, these behaviors were ameliorated after treatment with
      bright light. The present study further explores the possible utility of sand
      rats as animal models by testing the effects of antidepressants on the SP-induced
      depression-like behaviors of sand rats. Sand rats maintained in SP or NP
      conditions for 3 weeks were treated subchronically (5 injections) with the
      clinically effective antidepressant bupropion, and their behavior was tested in a
      number of depression-related tests. Results show that antidepressant treatment
      reverses the effects of SP conditions in the forced swim test, but that neither
      SP conditions nor antidepressants influenced sweet solution preference. These
      results partly support the validity of the sand rat model, but suggest that not
      all tests that were validated in nocturnal laboratory rodents can be applied to
      other rodent species and that additional tests should be applied to further
      explore the validity of the model.

TI  - Effects of acute and chronic exercise on disulfide-linked growth hormone
      variants.
PG  - 581-7
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31818c6d93 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that the appearance of disulfide-linked growth
      hormone (GH) aggregates during and after an acute resistance exercise test (ARET)
      in men could be influenced by chronic physical training. METHODS: Fourteen men
      (28 +/- 1 yr) underwent two different 8-wk physical training programs designed to
      improve military performance. Before and after chronic training, subjects
      performed an ARET (six sets of 10 repetition-maximum squat) and had venous blood 
      drawn pre-, mid-, and post-ARET (0, 15, and 30 min postexercise). To determine
      whether GH molecules were disulfide-linked, serum samples were chemically reduced
      via glutathione (GSH). Serum immunoreactive GH (IRGH) and immunofunctional GH
      (IFGH) concentrations were determined using two specific immunoassays, in
      nonreduced (-GSH) and reduced (+GSH) states. Data were analyzed using
      repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: No differences were observed in the GH
      responses of the two training programs; therefore, training group data were
      combined for analysis. GSH reduction increased the mean GH signal (-GSH: 1.4 +/- 
      0.3 microg x L(-1) vs +GSH: 1.7 +/- 0.3 microg x L(-1); P < 0.01) only when
      quantifying IRGH. Post hoc testing indicated that serum contained IRGH
      disulfide-linked GH aggregates at the mid, 0-, 15-, and 30-min posttime points of
      the ARET (P < 0.01), whereas GSH reduction did not affect IFGH concentrations.
      Chronic physical training had no effect on the ARET-induced GH response.
      CONCLUSION: Acute resistance exercise leads to the appearance of disulfide-linked
      IRGH aggregates, and this response does not appear to be affected by 8 wk of
      chronic physical training. The physiological significance of increased
      proportions of disulfide-linked GH aggregates postexercise remains uncertain;
      however, structural alterations in GH moieties after acute exercise may represent
      important regulatory steps in mediating GH biological activity at selected target
      tissues.

      supercritical fluid chromatography using evaporative light scattering detection.

AB  - The analysis of several plasticizers, widely used in the production of medical
      devices, was investigated on porous graphitic carbon (PGC) stationary phase in
      supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) with an evaporative light scattering
      detector (ELSD). Due to strong interaction of compounds with the PGC support,
      solvents of strong eluotropic strength were added to the CO2 supercritical fluid.
      The effect of alkyl chain (pentane, hexane, heptane) and chlorinated (CH2Cl2,
      CHCl3, CCl4) solvents was studied on the retention and on the ELSD detection of
      plasticizers. A co-solvent mixture composed of CHCl3/heptane, eluted under
      gradient mode, allowed a significant improvement of the ELSD response compared to
      the use of each solvent individually. Then, a central composite design (CCD) was 
      implemented to optimize both the separation and the detection of plasticizers.
      The parameters involved were the outlet pressure, the gradient slope, the
      co-solvent composition and the drift tube temperature of the ELSD. After
      optimization, baseline separation of plasticizers was achieved in 7min and best
      signal-to-noise ratios were obtained with outlet pressure and drift tube
      temperature of ELSD set at 200bar and 31 degrees C, respectively. The co-solvent 
      mixture was also composed of CHCl3/heptane (35/65 v/v) and a gradient from 15 to 
      60% of co-solvent in 2.2min was employed. The results demonstrated that CCD is a 
      powerful tool for the optimization of SFC/ELSD method and the response surface
      model analysis can provide statistical understandings of the significant factors 
      required to achieve optimal separation and ELSD sensitivity.

AB  - The proportion of women in militaries is growing; however, many studies in the
      area of military mental health have been conducted with majority male samples.
      The present study examined sex differences in trauma exposure, work stress, and
      mental disorders in the Canadian Community Health Survey - Canadian Forces
      Supplement, a representative sample of 5155 regular force personnel and 3286
      reservists ages 16-54. Past-year DSM-IV mental disorders (depression, generalized
      anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, PTSD, and alcohol dependence),
      lifetime exposure to 28 traumatic events, and work stress were assessed. Regular 
      and reserve female personnel were less likely than males to experience
      deployment-related traumas, accidents, and several events involving violence
      (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] range 0.10-0.62). Women were more likely to endorse
      sexual trauma, partner abuse, and being stalked (AOR range 3.60-13.63). For work 
      stress, regular force women reported higher levels of job demand and stress
      around social support than men, whereas regular and reserve force women reported 
      less physical exertion. After adjusting for a range of covariates, regular female
      personnel were more likely than males to have PTSD (AOR 1.88, 99% CI 1.01-3.50), 
      while reservist women were more likely than men to have depression, panic
      disorder, and any mood or anxiety disorder (AOR range 1.87-6.98). Both regular
      and reservist women had lower rates of alcohol dependence (AOR range 0.30-0.34). 
      Clinicians working with female personnel should screen for trauma/stressors and
      mental disorders that are particularly common in this population.

TI  - [Psychosocial intervention follow-up in children with ADHD: effects on academic, 
      emotional and social functioning].
PG  - 778-83
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to analyze the maintenance of the effects, one 
      year after its conclusion, of an intervention that integrated three coordinated
      programs, implemented with 27 children with ADHD, aged between 7 and 10 years,
      their parents and teachers. The intervention lasted 10 weeks and included
      behavior-modification and cognitive-behavioral techniques, academic adaptations
      and social skills. We evaluated the effects on academic, emotional and social
      adjustment from the information provided by parents, teachers and classmates. The
      results confirm the maintenance in the follow-up evaluation of the improvements
      experienced after the treatment, especially in the academic and social areas, in 
      which these children displayed the greatest difficulties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) belong to the next generation of
      synthetic nucleic acid analogues. Their high binding affinity and specificity
      towards the target DNA or RNA make them the reagent of choice for gene
      therapy-based applications. OBJECTIVE: To review important gene therapy based
      applications of regular and chemically modified peptide nucleic acids in
      combination with nanotechnology. METHOD: Selective research of the literature.
      RESULTS: Poor intracellular delivery of PNAs has been a significant challenge.
      Among several delivery strategies explored till date, nanotechnology-based
      strategies hold immense potential. Recent studies have shown that advances in
      nanotechnology can be used to broaden the range of therapeutic applications of
      PNAs. In this review, we discussed significant advances made in
      nanoparticle-based on PLGA polymer, silicon, oxidized carbon and graphene oxide
      for the delivery of PNAs. CONCLUSION: Nanoparticles delivered PNAs can be implied
      in diverse gene therapy based applications including gene editing as well as gene
      targeting (antisense) based strategies.

TI  - Analysis of asymmetries in air pollution with water resources, and energy
      consumption in Iran.
PG  - 17590-17601

AB  - Iran should pay special attention to its excessive consumption of energy and air 
      pollution due to the limited availability of water resources. This study explores
      the effects of the consumption of energy and water resources on air pollution in 
      Iran from 1971 to 2014. It utilizes the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag
      approach to establish a robust relationship between the variables which show that
      both long- and short-run coefficients are asymmetrical. The positive and negative
      aspects of the long-run coefficients of energy consumption and water resources
      were found to be 0.19, - 1.63, 0.18, and 2.36, respectively, while only the
      negative ones were significant for energy consumption. Based on the cumulative
      effects, it can be established that there are important and significant
      differences in the responses of air pollution to positive and negative changes in
      water productivity and energy consumption. In particular, CO2 gas emissions are
      affected by negative changes in H2O productivity both in terms of the total and
      the GDP per unit of energy use in Iran. In regard to short-run results,
      considerable asymmetric effects occur on all the variables for CO2 emissions.
      Based on the results obtained, some recommendations are presented, which
      policymakers can adopt in efforts to address the issues of pollution and
      consumption.

AB  - The composition of sedimentary pigments in the Antarctic lake at Edmonson Point
      has been investigated and compared with the aim to provide a useful analytical
      method for pigments separation and identification, providing reference data for
      future assessment of possible changes in environmental conditions. Reversed phase
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrospray-mass spectrometry
      (ESI-MS) detection and diode array detection (DAD) has been used to identify
      light screening and light harvesting pigments. The results are discussed in terms
      of local environmental conditions.

TI  - Multipoint anchoring of the [2.2.2.2]metacyclophane motif to a gold surface via
      self-assembly: coordination chemistry of a cyclic tetraisocyanide revisited.
PG  - 3284-91
LID - 10.1021/ic702401b [doi]
AB  - A one-pot transformation of bis(2-isocyano-3-methylphenyl)ethane affords gram
      quantities of 8,16,24,32-tetraisocyano[2.2.2.2]metacyclophane ( 3). The solid
      state structure of 3 is remarkably close to the lowest energy conformation found 
      on the potential energy landscape for 3 by DFT. In solution, the structure of
      metacyclophane 3 is mobile but can be locked in a rectangular gauche- anti-
      gauche- anti conformation by coordination of the isocyanide substituents to the
      [W(CO) 5] units to give [M] 4(mu 4-eta (1):eta (1):eta (1):eta (1)- 3) ( 5). The 
      tetranuclear [M] 4(mu 4-eta (1):eta (1):eta (1):eta (1)- 3) motif featured in
      crystallographically characterized 5 may be present in several insoluble
      complexes of 3 previously described as mononuclear eta (4) species. A
      self-assembled monolayer of metacyclophane 3 is formed upon exposing a solution
      of 3 to the gold(111) surface with no precautions to exclude air or light. The
      monolayer nature of the film was confirmed by optical ellipsometry. The
      isocyanide stretching band for 3 shifts from 2119 cm (-1) in solution to 2175 cm 
      (-1) upon chemisorption to metallic gold. The FTIR spectrum of the film indicates
      interaction of 3 with the gold surface via all four of its isocyanide anchors. No
      gold-facilitated oxidation of the -NC junctions was detected under ambient
      conditions. The energy cost associated with accessing the conformations of 3
      suitable for mu 4-eta (1):eta (1):eta (1):eta (1) interaction of the molecule
      with the Au(111) surface is under 8 kcal/mol, a value that can be easily offset
      by formation of a gold-isocyanide bond. Two different mu 4-eta (1):eta (1):eta
      (1):eta (1) coordination arrangements of 3 with respect to gold atoms on the
      (111) face of the fcc Au lattice are suggested.

AB  - The flux of ions across the biological membrane is a central activity to many
      cellular processes, from conduction of nerve impulse to the apoptosis. Traffic of
      ions or molecules across the membrane and organelles is governed by natural
      machines of great precision; ion channels, a special class of proteins, reside in
      the biological membranes. Recent studies in the field of nanoscience have
      concentrated on to precisely mimic the physical and chemical properties of these 
      pores that make them increasingly attractive in this field. Synthetic nanoporous 
      materials have a great deal of medical applications, including biosensing,
      biosorting, immune-isolation and drug delivery. In this review, the authors
      briefly describe the interesting synthetic channels that are extensively studied,
      and also attempt to furnish a precise overview of recent advances in this arena.

TI  - Poster - Thurs Eve-01: Comparison of clinical IMRT plan quality and delivery
      accuracy: Few large segments vs many small segments.
PG  - 3401
LID - 10.1118/1.2965920 [doi]
AB  - Commercial radiation treatment planning systems for intensity modulation use
      optimization algorithms that can vary multi-leaf collimator (MLC) segment sizes, 
      segment number and the minimum number of monitor units (MU) per segment. These
      parameters are varied according to the treatment site, size, location, and
      proximity to the organs at risk. This study compares the utility of optimization 
      using (Case A) few large segments and a higher minimum MU per segment to that of 
      (case B) using many smaller segments with a lower minimum MU per segment. For
      Case A, the patient benefits from a reduced treatment time associated with fewer 
      MUs and fewer MLC movements and an increased accuracy in dose delivery. Also,
      shorter treatment times may lead to fewer patient movement uncertainties. The
      accumulated MLC leakage dose is reduced, the patient specific quality assurance
      (QA) is more manageable and small field modeling inaccuracies are reduced.
      Pinnacle-3 (v8) plans are generated with direct machine parameter optimization
      (DMPO) for both scenarios. Three dimensional dose distributions and dose volume
      histograms are used to compare plan quality. We compare plans using few large MLC
      segments with those using many small MLC segments for some clinical cases.
      Improved plan quality is demonstrated using fewer MLC segments. Dose QAs are
      performed and compared for each scenario using MapCheck and film. When comparing 
      dose delivery accuracy between different MU per segment settings, a decrease in
      delivery errors with minimum MU size is observed. In conclusion, few large MLC
      segments with larger area should be used when possible.

TI  - Enhanced dark matter annihilation rate for positron and electron excesses from
      Q-ball decay.
PG  - 151301
AB  - We show that Q-ball decay in Affleck-Dine baryogenesis models can account for
      dark matter when the annihilation cross section is sufficiently enhanced to
      explain the positron and electron excesses observed by PAMELA, ATIC, and
      PPB-BETS. For Affleck-Dine baryogenesis along a d=6 flat direction, the reheating
      temperature is approximately 30 GeV and the Q-ball decay temperature is in the
      range of 10-100 MeV. The lightest supersymmetric particles produced by Q-ball
      decay annihilate down to the observed dark matter density if the cross section is
      enhanced by a factor approximately 10(3) relative to the thermal relic cross
      section.

TI  - Diversity of DIS, SD and psi hairpins in HIV-1 isolates of group M: in silico
      study.
PG  - 68-84
AB  - The primary sequence and secondary structure of the region encompassing DIS, SD
      and psi hairpins in HIV-1 genomic RNAs have been analyzed for 731 group M
      isolates from NCBI database. The secondary structures have been predicted by the 
      m fold program (M. Zuker). Though the primary sequence of the region studied was 
      found to be highly heterogeneous, this region is folded into DIS, SD and psi
      hairpins (DIS-, SD- and psi-like hairpins) in 96% of the isolates studied. The
      phylogenetic analysis showed that the most frequent variants of DIS hairpin
      (DIS(Lai), DIS(Mal) and DIS(C)) tolerate certain base changes. Particularly, base
      changes at stem position 23 occur 5 and 33 times more frequently in DIS(Lai) than
      in DIS(Mal) and DIS(C), respectively, while A insertion at the 5'end of apical
      loop is tolerated in DIS(Mal) and DIS(C) but not in DIS(Lai). We have revealed

TI  - The ongoing evolution of the core curriculum of a clinical fellowship in
      pathology informatics.

AB  - The Partners HealthCare system's Clinical Fellowship in Pathology Informatics
      (Boston, MA, USA) faces ongoing challenges to the delivery of its core curriculum
      in the forms of: (1) New classes of fellows annually with new and varying
      educational needs and increasingly fractured, enterprise-wide commitments; (2)
      taxing electronic health record (EHR) and laboratory information system (LIS)
      implementations; and (3) increasing interest in the subspecialty at the academic 
      medical centers (AMCs) in what is a large health care network. In response to
      these challenges, the fellowship has modified its existing didactic sessions and 
      piloted both a network-wide pathology informatics lecture series and regular
      "learning laboratories". Didactic sessions, which had previously included more
      formal discussions of the four divisions of the core curriculum: Information
      fundamentals, information systems, workflow and process, and governance and
      management, now focus on group discussions concerning the fellows' ongoing
      projects, updates on the enterprise-wide EHR and LIS implementations, and
      directed questions about weekly readings. Lectures are given by the informatics
      faculty, guest informatics faculty, current and former fellows, and information
      systems members in the network, and are open to all professional members of the
      pathology departments at the AMCs. Learning laboratories consist of small-group
      exercises geared toward a variety of learning styles, and are driven by both the 
      fellows and a member of the informatics faculty. The learning laboratories have
      created a forum for discussing real-time and real-world pathology informatics
      matters, and for incorporating awareness of and timely discussions about the
      latest pathology informatics literature. These changes have diversified the
      delivery of the fellowship's core curriculum, increased exposure of faculty,
      fellows and trainees to one another, and more equitably distributed teaching
      responsibilities among the entirety of the pathology informatics asset in the
      network. Though the above approach has been in place less than a year, we are
      presenting it now as a technical note to allow for further discussion of evolving
      educational opportunities in pathology informatics and clinical informatics in
      general, and to highlight the importance of having a flexible fellowship with
      active participation from its fellows.

TI  - Enhancing treatment for school-age children who stutter I. Reducing negative
      reactions through desensitization and cognitive restructuring.
PG  - 121-38
AB  - UNLABELLED: This paper describes several treatment strategies that clinicians can
      use to address negative affective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions that
      school-age children who stutter may experience as part of their disorder.
      Specific strategies include desensitization to stuttering, cognitive
      restructuring, self-acceptance, purposeful self-disclosure, and a combination of 
      both fluency enhancing and stuttering modification approaches. To facilitate
      clinicians' application of these techniques, the strategies are presented in the 
      context of a case study involving a 9-year-old boy who participated in a
      comprehensive treatment program for stuttering. Following treatment, the child
      exhibited improved communication attitudes and a reduced frequency and severity
      of stuttering, combined with reduced concern about stuttering, as indicated
      through formal and informal assessments. Findings suggest that clinicians can
      help children overcome the negative reactions associated with stuttering through 
      a number of treatment strategies that can be applied in a variety of clinical
      settings. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: After reading this article, participants will
      be able to: (1) define desensitization and cognitive restructuring and provide
      two arguments in favor of using these strategies in treatment for school-age
      children who stutter; (2) describe two treatment strategies for helping
      school-age children achieve desensitization through stuttering therapy; (3)
      describe two treatment strategies for helping school-age children engage in
      cognitive restructuring in the context of therapy.

TI  - Abortion surveillance - United States, 2011.
PG  - 1-41
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Since 1969, CDC has conducted abortion surveillance to
      document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced
      abortions in the United States. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2011. DESCRIPTION OF
      SYSTEM: Each year, CDC requests abortion data from the central health agencies of
      52 reporting areas (the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City). 
      The reporting areas provide this information voluntarily. For 2011, data were
      received from 49 reporting areas. For trend analysis, abortion data were
      evaluated from 46 areas that reported data every year during 2002-2011. Census
      and natality data, respectively, were used to calculate abortion rates (number of
      abortions per 1,000 women) and ratios (number of abortions per 1,000 live
      births). RESULTS: A total of 730,322 abortions were reported to CDC for 2011. Of 
      these abortions, 98.3% were from the 46 reporting areas that provided data every 
      year during 2002-2011. Among these same 46 reporting areas, the abortion rate for
      2011 was 13.9 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years, and the abortion ratio 
      was 219 abortions per 1,000 live births. From 2010 to 2011, the total number and 
      rate of reported abortions decreased 5% and the abortion ratio decreased 4%, and 
      from 2002 to 2011, the total number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions
      decreased 13%, 14%, and 12%, respectively. In 2011, all three measures reached
      their lowest level for the entire period of analysis (2002-2011). In 2011 and
      throughout the period of analysis, women in their 20s accounted for the majority 
      of abortions and had the highest abortion rates, and women in their 30s and older
      accounted for a much smaller percentage of abortions and had lower abortion
      rates. In 2011, women aged 20-24 and 25-29 years accounted for 32.9% and 24.9% of
      all abortions, respectively, and had abortion rates of 24.9 and 19.4 abortions
      per 1,000 women aged 20-24 and 25-29 years, respectively. In contrast, women aged
      30-34, 35-39, and >/=40 years accounted for 15.8%, 8.9%, and 3.6% of all
      abortions, respectively, and had abortion rates of 12.7, 7.5, and 2.8 abortions
      per 1,000 women aged 30-34 years, 35-39 years, and >/=40 years, respectively.
      Throughout the period of analysis, abortion rates decreased among women aged
      20-24 and 25-29 years by 21% and 16%, respectively, whereas they increased among 
      women aged >/=40 years by 8%. In 2011, adolescents aged <15 and 15-19 years
      accounted for 0.4% and 13.5% of all abortions, respectively, and had abortion
      rates of 0.9 and 10.5 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged <15 and 15-19 years,
      respectively. From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of abortions accounted for by
      adolescents aged 15-19 years decreased 21% and their abortion rate decreased 34%.
      These decreases were greater than the decreases for women in any older age group.
      In contrast to the percentage distribution of abortions and abortion rates by
      age, abortion ratios in 2011 and throughout the entire period of analysis were
      highest among adolescents and lowest among women aged 30-39 years. Abortion
      ratios decreased from 2002 to 2011 for women in all age groups except for those
      aged <15 years, for whom they increased. In 2011, most (64.5%) abortions were
      performed by </=8 weeks' gestation, and nearly all (91.4%) were performed by
      </=13 weeks' gestation. Few abortions (7.3%) were performed between 14-20 weeks' 
      gestation or at >/=21 weeks' gestation (1.4%). From 2002 to 2011, the percentage 
      of all abortions performed at </=8 weeks' gestation increased 6%. In 2011, among 
      reporting areas that included medical (nonsurgical) abortion on their reporting
      form, a total of 71.0% of abortions were performed by curettage at </=13 weeks'
      gestation, 19.1% were performed by early medical abortion (a nonsurgical abortion
      at </=8 weeks' gestation), and 8.6% were performed by curettage at >13 weeks'
      gestation; all other methods were uncommon. Among abortions performed at </=8
      weeks' gestation that were eligible for early medical abortion on the basis of
      gestational age, 28.5% were completed by this method. The percentage of abortions
      reported as early medical abortions increased 3% from 2010 to 2011. Deaths of
      women associated with complications from abortions for 2011 are being
      investigated as part of CDC's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System. In 2010,
      the most recent year for which data were available, 10 women were identified to
      have died as a result of complications from known legal induced abortions. No
      reported deaths were associated with known illegal induced abortions.
      INTERPRETATION: Among the 46 areas that reported data every year during
      2002-2011, large decreases in the total number, rate, and ratio of reported
      abortions from 2010 to 2011, in combination with decreases that occurred during
      2008-2010, resulted in historic lows for all three measures of abortion. PUBLIC
      HEALTH ACTIONS: Unintended pregnancy is the major contributor to abortion.
      Because unintended pregnancies are rare among women who use the most effective
      methods of contraception, increasing access to and use of these methods can help 
      further reduce the number of abortions performed in the United States. The data
      in this report can help program planners and policy makers identify groups of
      women at greatest risk for unintended pregnancy and help guide and evaluate
      prevention efforts.

TI  - Direct calculation of solid-liquid coexistence points of a binary mixture by
      thermodynamic integration.
PG  - 194503
AB  - We present a new thermodynamic integration method that directly connects the
      liquid and the solid phases of a binary mixture by a reversible path. The states 
      along the path are simulated in the isothermal-isobaric semigrand canonical
      ensemble, in which temperature, pressure, the total number of particles, and the 
      fugacity fractions of the components are held fixed. The thermodynamic
      integration yields the chemical-potential difference between the two phases for
      one of the components and this information is then used to locate the
      solid-liquid coexistence points. The melting temperatures predicted by our method
      agree well with those predicted by the Gibbs-Duhem integration for a truncated
      and shifted Lennard-Jones system with a cutoff radius of 2.5sigma.

TI  - Genetic Separation of Sae2 Nuclease Activity from Mre11 Nuclease Functions in
      Budding Yeast.
LID - e00156-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00156-17 [doi]
AB  - Sae2 promotes the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      The role of Sae2 is linked to the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX) complex, which is
      important for the processing of DNA ends into single-stranded substrates for
      homologous recombination. Sae2 has intrinsic endonuclease activity, but the role 
      of this activity has not been assessed independently from its functions in
      promoting Mre11 nuclease activity. Here we identify and characterize
      separation-of-function mutants that lack intrinsic nuclease activity or the
      ability to promote Mre11 endonucleolytic activity. We find that the ability of
      Sae2 to promote MRX nuclease functions is important for DNA damage survival,
      particularly in the absence of Dna2 nuclease activity. In contrast, Sae2 nuclease
      activity is essential for DNA repair when the Mre11 nuclease is compromised.
      Resection of DNA breaks is impaired when either Sae2 activity is blocked,
      suggesting roles for both Mre11 and Sae2 nuclease activities in promoting the
      processing of DNA ends in vivo Finally, both activities of Sae2 are important for
      sporulation, indicating that the processing of meiotic breaks requires both Mre11
      and Sae2 nuclease activities.

TI  - [Concentrations of adrenal steroids and sex hormones in postmenopausal women
      suffering from coronary artery disease].
PG  - 326-9
AB  - UNLABELLED: The lack of the benefits in the prevention of coronary artery disease
      (CAD) from the hormonal substitution with preparations of estradiol (E2) suggests
      that higher frequency of CAD in postmenopausal women (PMW) may be influenced by a
      hormonal mechanism different from the postmenopausal hypoestrogenism. AIM OF THE 
      STUDY: Due to the fact adrenal glands are the important source of steroids in PMW
      the aim of our research was the assessment of the concentrations of the adrenal
      hormones and their possible relations with CAD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: W-CAD
      group--31 PMW at the age of 66 +/- 9 years with angiographically proven CAD; 3/4 
      of them suffered from myocardial infarction. W-H group--17 healthy women at the
      age of 59 +/- 7 years. Common clinical and biochemical risk factors were searched
      for in each and every of the PMW. In the venous blood samples taken from them by 
      means of immunological methods the concentrations of the hormones were assessed: 
      starving insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), E2, progesterone,
      testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol, aldosterone,
      androstenedione, folliculotropic hormone and luteinising hormone. The levels of
      the hormones were compared between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was
      used to discover possible relations among the clinical and hormonal parameters
      and CAD. RESULTS: In W-CAD mean concentration of DHEAS was lower than in W-H,
      close to the significant value (75 +/- 76 vs 102 +/- 79 microg/dl, p<0,08). In
      PMW with CAD mean concentration of cortisol (18 +/- 5 vs 15 +/- 6 microg/dl,
      p<0,07) and ACTH was higher, but mean concentration of aldosterone was more than 
      twice as small as in the healthy ones. The levels of the rest aforementioned
      hormones were similar in the groups. In the univariate model created by logistic 
      regression analysis DHEAS was the only hormone that revealed the significant
      relation between its level and the occurrence of CAD. CONCLUSION: In PMW
      diminished concentration of DHEAS is correlated with occurrence of CAD. The
      differences of the concentrations of the other hormones between PMW with and
      without CAD need further observation.

TI  - Absence of fks1p in lager brewing yeast results in aberrant cell wall composition
      and improved beer flavor stability.
PG  - 1901-8
LID - 10.1007/s11274-014-1617-0 [doi]
AB  - The flavor stability during storage is very important to the freshness and shelf 
      life of beer. However, beer fermented with a yeast strain which is prone to
      autolyze will significantly affect the flavor of product. In this study, the gene
      encoding beta-1,3-glucan synthetase catalytic subunit (fks1) of the lager yeast
      was destroyed via self-clone strategy. beta-1,3-glucan is the principle cell wall
      component, so fks1 disruption caused a decrease in beta-1,3-glucan level and
      increase in chitin level in cell wall, resulting in the increased cell wall
      thickness. Comparing with wild-type strain, the mutant strain had 39.9 and 63.41 
      % less leakage of octanoic acid and decanoic acid which would significantly
      affect the flavor of beer during storage. Moreover, the results of European
      Brewery Convention tube fermentation test showed that the genetic manipulation to
      the industrial brewing yeast helped with the anti-staling ability, rather than
      affecting the fermentation ability. The thiobarbituric acid value reduced by
      65.59 %, and the resistant staling value increased by 26.56 %. Moreover, the
      anti-staling index of the beer fermented with mutant strain increased by
      2.64-fold than that from wild-type strain respectively. China has the most
      production and consumption of beer around the world, so the quality of beer has a
      significant impact on Chinese beer industry. The result of this study could help 
      with the improvement of the quality of beer in China as well as around the world.

TI  - Restenosis After Carotid Endarterectomy: Insight Into Risk Factors and
      Modification of Postoperative Management.

LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2016.01.028 [doi]
LID - S1878-8750(16)00111-X [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a potential
      complication after surgery for carotid stenosis. Stroke after CEA is a
      debilitating complication secondary to restenosis, and modification of
      postoperative care may be necessary to decrease the incidence of postoperative
      stroke after CEA. We sought to identify the clinical and patient factors that are
      associated with this complication. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all
      neurosurgical patients who underwent CEA for symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid 
      stenosis was performed. Factors were compared against the outcome variable in a
      univariate analysis. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to
      identify independent predictive variables. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to
      compare the effect of the variables on long-term event-free survival. RESULTS: A 
      total of 273 CEA procedures and their outcomes were analyzed with a mean
      follow-up of 50.7 months. Twenty-one patients had restenosis (7.6%). Rates of
      restenosis and restenosis-free survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves
      (log-rank test). In the multivariate model, a family history of stroke was the
      only variable that was significantly associated with restenosis after CEA.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a family history of stroke is an important
      factor that predisposes patients to restenosis after CEA. Restenosis-free
      survival is influenced by the presence of hyperlipidemia, age, and family history
      of stroke. Closer surveillance with more frequent follow-up and multidisciplinary
      management may be beneficial in patients who have these risk factors to prevent
      restenosis and prolong restenosis-free survival.

      domestic violence against women in Iranian society.
PG  - 6172-6178
LID - 10.19082/6172 [doi]
AB  - Background: Domestic violence is the third sociopathology after addiction and
      child abuse in Iran. Fifty-six percent of Iranian women in the range of 17-32
      years old are exposed to the highest domestic violence. Objective: The aim of
      this study was to design and psychoanalyze a comprehensive questionnaire on
      coping with domestic violence against women in Iranian society. Methods: This
      study was carried out on a random sample of women exposed to domestic violence
      and referred to the health and care center of Shahid Beheshti University of
      Medical Sciences in Tehran, and Forensic Medical Centers in Urmia city (Iran), in
      2017. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed among the participants. One
      hundred sixty-eight questionnaires were returned to the researchers for data
      analysis. Eight of those were excluded from the analysis because of
      incompleteness. Finally, exploratory factor analysis was performed. Results:
      After reviewing the literature, a questionnaire with 32 items was developed.
      Content validity ratio (0.95) and content validity index (0.97) were obtained.
      The results of exploratory factor analysis indicated that the questionnaire
      explained 69.34% of the data variance. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and
      test-retest methods were used for determining the reliability and the obtained
      value, which were 0.82 and 0.81, respectively. Conclusion: Validity and
      reliability of the questionnaire with 32 items were confirmed. The tool can be
      utilized to measure how women cope with domestic violence.

TI  - Optimization of Individual Pharmacotherapy Based on Multiple Evaluations of
      Patient Data.
PG  - 149-157
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b18-00766 [doi]
AB  - To date, limited drug information is available for the individual optimization of
      pharmacotherapy. The author attempted multiple evaluations of patient data on
      factors related to the pharmacokinetics, drug efficacy, and adverse reactions
      observed in clinical settings. Through the clinical studies, drug information on 
      the individual optimization of pharmacotherapy needed by health professionals
      including physicians and pharmacists was identified. Major findings were: 1)
      Cachectic cancer patients had high plasma concentrations of oxycodone via the
      reduction of CYP3A activity. The metabolic reduction in cachectic cancer patients
      was potentially related to the elevated serum level of interleukin-6. 2) Dopamine
      receptor D2 (DRD2) genetic mutations and being female led to poor antiemetic
      efficacy of the treatment of opioid-induced nausea in prochlorperazine-treated
      patients. The opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1) wild genotype in addition to being
      female and having high plasma concentrations of prochlorperazine increased
      prolactin secretion during oxycodone treatment. 3) Rheumatoid arthritis patients 
      with a genetic mutation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) had 
      high plasma concentrations of tacrolimus and its 13-O-demethylate. The ABCB1
      genetic mutation and associated high plasma concentration of tacrolimus decreased
      kidney function. 4) Chronic inflammation increased the plasma voriconazole
      concentration via its poor metabolism, whereas it did not alter the plasma
      itraconazole concentration. Although co-administration of prednisolone did not
      affect the plasma concentration of triazole antifungals, it weakly increased
      voriconazole metabolism. 5) In breastfeeding women, the median milk/plasma
      concentration ratio of amlodipine was 0.85. However, the observed relative infant
      dose of amlodipine in most patients was less than 10%.

TI  - Effects of cross-fostering on alcohol preference and correlated responses to
      selection in high- and low-alcohol-preferring mice.
PG  - 2065-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01839.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selectively bred rodent lines are valuable tools for investigating
      gene x environment interactions related to risk for alcoholism in humans. Early
      maternal environment is one particular factor known for critically influencing
      neural, hormonal, and behavioral outcomes in adulthood. Cross-fostering is a
      procedure that may be used to explore the role of genotype-dependent maternal
      influences on phenotypic variability in adulthood. The purpose of these
      experiments was to examine the effects of cross-fostering on free-choice alcohol 
      drinking and correlated responses to selection for alcohol preference in mice
      selectively bred for high (HAP2) and low (LAP2) alcohol preference. METHODS: Mice
      were assigned to one of the following treatments: SHAM (pups that were fostered
      to their original biological mother), IN (pups that were fostered to a different 
      mother of the same line), and CROSS (pups that were fostered to a mother of a
      different line). Mice were tested in adulthood for (i) free 24-hour access to
      alcohol for a period of 28 days; (ii) the expression of the acoustic startle
      response and fear-potentiated startle (FPS); and (iii) handling-induced
      convulsions (HICs) during acute alcohol withdrawal. RESULTS: Overall, the
      expression of the alcohol preference selection phenotype was robust in all groups
      (HAP2 > LAP2). Cross-fostering produced a moderate but significant reduction in
      g/kg alcohol drinking and preference scores in HAP2 mice (CROSS < SHAM) but had
      no effect in LAP2 mice. Cross-fostering did not affect the expression of
      correlated responses to selection: acoustic startle response (HAP2 > LAP2), FPS
      (HAP2 > LAP2), HICs (LAP2 > HAP2). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that maternal
      environment can modify the expression of the high-alcohol-preference phenotype in
      HAP2 selectively bred mice. These results suggest a gene x environment
      interaction with respect to the expression of the high-alcohol-preference
      selection phenotype but not correlated responses to selection.

TI  - Identification of metal dithiocarbamates as a novel class of antileishmanial
      agents.
PG  - 2144-52
LID - 10.1128/AAC.05146-14 [doi]
AB  - Dithiocarbamates have emerged as potent carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors in
      recent years. Given that CAs are important players in cellular metabolism, the
      objective of this work was to exploit the CA-inhibitory property of
      dithiocarbamates as a chemotherapeutic weapon against the Leishmania parasite. We
      report here strong antileishmanial activity of three hitherto unexplored metal
      dithiocarbamates, maneb, zineb, and propineb. They inhibited CA activity in
      Leishmania major promastigotes at submicromolar concentrations and resulted in a 
      dose-dependent inhibition of parasite growth. Treatment with maneb, zineb, and
      propineb caused morphological deformities of the parasite and Leishmania cell
      death with 50% lethal dose (LD50) values of 0.56 muM, 0.61 muM, and 0.27 muM,
      respectively. These compounds were even more effective against parasites growing 
      in acidic medium, in which their LD50 values were severalfold lower.
      Intracellular acidosis leading to apoptotic and necrotic death of L. major
      promastigotes was found to be the basis of their leishmanicidal activity. Maneb, 
      zineb, and propineb also efficiently reduced the intracellular parasite burden,
      suggesting that amastigote forms of the parasite are also susceptible to these
      metal dithiocarbamates. Interestingly, mammalian cells were unaffected by these
      compounds even at concentrations which are severalfold higher than their
      antileishmanial LD50s). Our data thus establish maneb, zineb, and propineb as a
      new class of antileishmanial compounds having broad therapeutic indices.

TI  - Introducing traditional Chinese nursing: a review of concepts, theories and
      practices.
PG  - 319-27
LID - 10.1111/j.1466-7657.2011.00918.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This paper discussed the basic concepts, theories and practices of
      traditional Chinese nursing (TCN) to enrich our understanding of relevant
      concepts and ways to contribute to human health. BACKGROUND: Advantages of TCN
      include health education based on theories and techniques of traditional Chinese 
      medicine. It focuses mainly on mobilizing humans' capacity for self-adjustment
      and self-rehabilitation to make a dynamic balance between yin and yang, qi and
      blood and zang and fu. It has played a significant role in the fields of primary 
      nursing, geriatric nursing, hospice, family nursing, etc., in China. METHOD:
      PubMed, CINAHL, Ovid Medline (English) and the Wang Fang (Chinese) databases were
      searched for literature on a range of keywords relating to traditional Chinese
      medicine and nursing. Forty references (13 English and 27 Chinese) were finally
      selected for review. CONCLUSION: Practices of nursing care in traditional Chinese
      medicine are based mainly on the theories of yin-yang and the five elements.
      There are two prime characteristics in the theoretical system of TCN: holism and 
      nursing determination based on syndrome differentiation. The distinctive content 
      include prevention, daily care of patients, dietary nursing, etc. TCN, with its
      characteristics of little damage, little pain, ease of operation and low cost, is
      appropriately used in primary health care in China. By combining Western and
      Eastern philosophies and approaches to nursing, life phenomena can be better
      understood, and more ways to promote health can be exploited. Scientists are
      beginning to use Western research methods to establish effectiveness. Many common
      interventions would not, however, be considered safe in Western nursing practice 
      without more evidence and consideration of health and safety issues.

TI  - Effect of sub-lethal exposure to ultraviolet radiation on the escape performance 
      of Atlantic cod larvae (Gadus morhua).
PG  - e35554
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0035554 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the earth's surface
      has increased due to depletion of the ozone layer. Several studies have reported 
      that UV radiation reduces survival of fish larvae. However, indirect and
      sub-lethal impacts of UV radiation on fish behavior have been given little
      consideration. We observed the escape performance of larval cod (24 dph, SL:
      7.6+/-0.2 mm; 29 dph, SL: 8.2+/-0.3 mm) that had been exposed to sub-lethal
      levels of UV radiation vs. unexposed controls. Two predators were used (in
      separate experiments): two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens; a suction
      predator) and lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata; a "passive" ambush
      predator). Ten cod larvae were observed in the presence of a predator for 20
      minutes using a digital video camera. Trials were replicated 4 times for goby and
      5 times for jellyfish. Escape rate (total number of escapes/total number of
      attacks x100), escape distance and the number of larvae remaining at the end of
      the experiment were measured. In the experiment with gobies, in the UV-treated
      larvae, both escape rate and escape distance (36%, 38+/-7.5 mm respectively) were
      significantly lower than those of control larvae (75%, 69+/-4.7 mm respectively).
      There was a significant difference in survival as well (UV: 35%, CONTROL: 63%).
      No apparent escape response was observed, and survival rate was not significantly
      different, between treatments (UV: 66%, CONTROL: 74%) in the experiment with
      jellyfish. We conclude that the effect and impact of exposure to sub-lethal
      levels of UV radiation on the escape performance of cod larvae depends on the
      type of predator. Our results also suggest that prediction of UV impacts on fish 
      larvae based only on direct effects are underestimations.

TI  - Growth of Streptococcus mutans in Biofilms Alters Peptide Signaling at the
      Sub-population Level.
PG  - 1075
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01075 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus mutans activates multiple cellular processes in response to the
      formation of a complex between comX-inducing peptide (XIP) and the ComR
      transcriptional regulator. Bulk phase and microfluidic experiments previously
      revealed that ComR-dependent activation of comX is altered by pH and by
      carbohydrate source. Biofilm formation is a major factor in bacterial survival
      and virulence in the oral cavity. Here, we sought to determine the response of S.
      mutans biofilm cells to XIP during different stages of biofilm maturation. Using 
      flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we showed that exogenous addition of XIP 
      to early biofilms resulted in robust comX activation. However, as the biofilms
      matured, increasing amounts of XIP were required to activate comX expression.
      Single-cell analysis demonstrated that the entire population was responding to
      XIP with activation of comX in early biofilms, but only a sub-population was
      responding in mature biofilms. The sub-population response of mature biofilms was
      retained when the cells were dispersed and then treated with XIP. The proportion 
      and intensity of the bi-modal response of mature biofilm cells was altered in
      mutants lacking the Type II toxins MazF and RelE, or in a strain lacking the
      (p)ppGpp synthase/hydrolase RelA. Thus, competence signaling is markedly altered 
      in cells growing in mature biofilms, and pathways that control cell death and
      growth/survival decisions modulate activation of comX expression in these sessile
      populations.

PG  - 35-47

AB  - Summary Research into the influence of parental lesbianism on child development
      has not revealed any meaningful nor significant differences between the children 
      of lesbian and heterosexual parents. While such research helps to disprove
      negative assumptions about lesbian mothers, the focus has been on the potential
      problems and disadvantages of this difference from the norm. In interviews with
      17 British teenagers and adults who have lesbian mothers, respondents suggested
      distinct advantages for themselves which they attributed to their mother's
      sexuality. They spoke of the influence their mothers had on their moral
      development, particularly on their awareness of prejudice and their acceptance of
      diversity and of homosexuality. They felt they had benefited from the insights
      they gained into gender relations and from the broader, more inclusive definition
      of family they acquired through growing up in a different kind of family.

TI  - Fostering self-determination of bedside providers to promote active participation
      in rapid response events.
PG  - 1551028
LID - 10.1080/10872981.2018.1551028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread implementation of rapid response (RR) systems positively
      impacts outcomes of clinically unstable hospitalized patients. Collaboration
      between bedside providers and specialized responding teams is crucial for
      effective functioning of RR system. Bedside, providers often harbor negative
      feelings about having to 'call for help' that could impact their active
      participation in RR. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to enhance active
      participation of bedside providers in RR by fostering self-determination through 
      targeted education. DESIGN: Needs assessment affirmed that bedside providers in
      our tertiary academic pediatric hospital felt loss of control over patient care, 
      lack of competence, and disconnect from the RR team. We used the principles of
      autonomy, competence, and relatedness posited by the self-determination theory to
      guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of our educational program 
      for bedside providers. RESULTS: Forty-two bedside providers participated in our
      program. Participants reported significant improvement in RR-related clinical
      knowledge. More importantly, there was significant enhancement in individual
      perceptions of autonomy (pre-mean: 2.12, post-mean: 4.4) competence (pre-mean:
      2.15, post-mean: 4.4), and relatedness (pre-mean: 2.65, post-mean: 4.5) with RR
      (p < 0.01). The evaluation results for overall educational effectiveness showed a
      mean score of 4.69 +/- 0.79. All scores were based on a 5-point Likert scale of
      1: poor to 5: excellent. Educators noted good participant engagement. The
      program's structure, evaluations, and data management were modified based on the 
      feedback. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed and implemented targeted
      educational program for bedside providers based on self-determination theory. The
      evaluations showed improvement in bedside providers' clinical RR knowledge and
      perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness following the training.

TI  - Influenza in older patients: a call to action and recent updates for
      vaccinations.
PG  - S15-S24
AB  - Influenza affects millions of people in the United States each year. Older
      patients are particularly at risk for infection, hospitalization, and death due
      to influenza-related complications, such as pneumonia. One of the best ways to
      avoid becoming ill is to have the annual influenza vaccination. Unfortunately,
      immunization rates are poor in the older adult population, at about 65% each
      year. Vaccine effectiveness in this population is reduced because of lower
      seroconversion rates that arise from poorer immunologic response to vaccination. 
      Several new influenza vaccines that have been introduced to the market in recent 
      years attempt to boost immune response, including high-dose formulations and
      adjuvanted and recombinant vaccines. Managed care pharmacists need to understand 
      the utility of these new agents in populations 65 years or older. This supplement
      highlights the impact of influenza on older patients, the features of new vaccine
      preparations, and the economic burden of influenza.

TI  - Individual and maternal determinants of self-reported dental health among Turkish
      school children aged 10-12 years.
PG  - 84-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of maternal and individual characteristics on 
      self-reported dental health of Turkish school children aged 10-12 years with
      different socio-economic backgrounds. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of children
      aged 10 to 12 (n = 611) using paired matches of self-administered questionnaires 
      for children and their mothers. Clinical examinations based on World Health
      Organization criteria were conduced. The participation rate was 97% (n = 591) for
      the children, 87% (n = 533) for the mothers, and 95% (n = 584) for the clinical
      examinations. Multiple linear regression, descriptive statistics, Spearman
      correlation coefficient and chi-square test were applied. RESULTS: Private school
      children's mothers were more likely to have had higher education (95% at least
      high school) than public school children's mothers (11%); they reported better
      dental health (above average) than did mothers of public school children (p =
      0.001). Among all mothers, those with above average self-reported dental health
      reported more regular dental visits than did those with below average scores (p =
      0.001). Frequency of regular dental visits and toothbrushing among children
      attending public schools (5%, 65%) were lower than those attending private school
      (43%, 79%), (p = 0.001). The mean DMFS was negatively correlated with
      self-reported dental health (r(s) = -0.187, p = 0.001). Toothbrushing frequency
      and school performance were the common factors positively associated with
      self-reported dental health, among all children. CONCLUSION: The results
      emphasize the important role of mothers and their socio-economic background in
      enhancement of children's dental health. Their active role in conjunction with
      the potential of self-assessment provides a good basis for establishing and
      improving self-care among children, in developing countries in particular.

      hemolytic uremic syndrome.
PG  - 136-140
LID - 10.4103/0971-4065.181462 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is common in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and often difficult to 
      control. Local renin-angiotensin activation is believed to be an important part
      of thrombotic microangiopathy, leading to a vicious cycle of progressive renal
      injury and intractable hypertension. This has been demonstrated in vitro via
      enhanced tissue factor expression on glomerular endothelial cells which is
      enhanced by angiotensin II. We report two pediatric cases of atypical HUS with
      severe refractory malignant hypertension, in which we targeted the
      renin-angiotensin system by using intravenous (IV) enalaprilat, oral aliskiren,
      and oral enalapril with quick and dramatic response of blood pressure. Both
      drugs, aliskiren and IV enalaprilat, were effective in controlling hypertension
      refractory to multiple antihypertensive medications. These appear to be promising
      alternatives in the treatment of severe atypical HUS-induced hypertension and
      hypertensive emergency.

TI  - Effects of irradiation on brain vasculature using an in situ tumor model.
PG  - 1075-82
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.06.1984 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Damage to normal tissue is a limiting factor in clinical radiotherapy
      (RT). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of 
      normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the
      in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT
      regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints 
      included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial
      interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial
      fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to 
      RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham
      experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane
      matrix absent of tumor cells. RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases
      permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and
      astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability,
      leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of
      permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and
      irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of
      rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance.
      Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to
      irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the
      presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of
      apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with
      and without radiation. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate 
      that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of
      normal tissues to irradiation.

TI  - Acceptability of HIV Testing Sites Among Rural and Urban African Americans Who
      Use Cocaine.
PG  - 576-586
LID - 10.1007/s10461-016-1527-2 [doi]
AB  - African Americans (AAs) who use cocaine in the Southern region of the U.S. have a
      relatively high risk of HIV and need for HIV testing. Among this group, those
      residing in rural areas may have less favorable opinions about common HIV testing
      sites, which could inhibit HIV testing. We examined rural/urban variations in
      their acceptability of multiple HIV testing sites (private physician clinic,
      local health department, community health center, community HIV fair, hospital
      emergency department, blood plasma donation center, drug abuse treatment
      facility, and mobile van or community outreach worker). Results from partial
      proportional odds and logistic regression analyses indicate that rural AA who use
      cocaine have lower odds of viewing local health departments (OR = 0.09, 95 % CI =
      0.03-0.21), physician offices (OR = 0.19, 95 % CI = 0.09-0.42), and drug use
      treatment centers (OR = 0.49; 95 % CI = 0.30-0.80) as acceptable relative to
      their urban counterparts. The findings have implications for further targeting
      HIV testing toward AAs who use of cocaine, particularly those residing in the
      rural South.

TI  - Apolipoprotein E polymorphisms in Japanese patients with polypoidal choroidal
      vasculopathy and exudative age-related macular degeneration.
PG  - 567-73
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the genotypes, allelic frequencies, and polymorphisms of
      apolipoprotein E (Apo E) in unrelated Japanese patients with polypoidal choroidal
      vasculopathy (PCV) or exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and
      control subjects without macular degeneration. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
      METHODS: Blood samples from 225 subjects older than 50 years were used. The 225
      subjects included 58 patients with PCV, 85 with AMD, and 82 without macular
      degeneration. Coding exons of the Apo E gene were amplified by polymerase chain
      reaction, and the DNA sequences were determined by direct sequencing with an
      automated sequencer. RESULTS: Apo E epsilon3/epsilon3 was the most frequent
      genotype with a prevalence of 79.3% in PCV patients, 76.5% in AMD patients, and
      67.1% in the control subjects. However, the differences in the percentages were
      not statistically significant among the three groups. The most frequently found
      allele in the three groups was epsilon3. Patients with PCV and AMD were less
      likely to have epsilon2 and epsilon4 than the control subjects, but the
      differences were not statistically significant. Five minor Apo E single
      nucleotide polymorphisms, including epsilon5 and epsilon7, were found.
      CONCLUSION: Japanese patients with PCV and AMD were less likely to have epsilon2 
      and epsilon4 polymorphisms, but the differences from the normals were not
      statistically significant for the Apo E genotypes and allelic frequencies.

TI  - 19F and 1H MRI detection of amyloid beta plaques in vivo.
PG  - 527-33
AB  - Formation of senile plaques composed of amyloid beta peptide, a pathological
      hallmark of Alzheimer disease, in human brains precedes disease onset by many
      years. Noninvasive detection of such plaques could be critical in presymptomatic 
      diagnosis and could contribute to early preventive treatment strategies. Using
      amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice as a model of amyloid beta
      amyloidosis, we demonstrate here that an intravenously administered
      (19)F-containing amyloidophilic compound labels brain plaques and allows them to 
      be visualized in living mice by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using (19)F and 
      (1)H. Our findings provide a new direction for specific noninvasive amyloid
      imaging without the danger of exposure to radiation. This approach could be used 
      in longitudinal studies in mouse models of Alzheimer disease to search for
      biomarkers associated with amyloid beta pathology as well as to track disease
      course after treatment with candidate medications.

TI  - Assessment of quality of care in postpartum wards of Shaheed Beheshti Medical
      Science University hospitals, 2004.
PG  - 333-42
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite 77 per cent antenatal care coverage and 90 per cent skilled
      attendant at delivery, adjusted maternal mortality in Iran is 76 per 100,000
      births. Low quality of maternal health services is one cause of maternal
      morbidity and mortality. However, few and limited studies have been devoted to
      the quality of postpartum care in Iran. This study aims to assess quality of care
      in postpartum wards of Shaheed Beheshti Medical Science University hospitals to
      show weakness and gaps areas in the care procedure for future improvement
      intervention programs. It is a descriptive study to assess quality of care in
      postpartum wards of Shaheed Beheshti Medical Science University hospitals, in
      2003. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Using quota sampling, 60 healthy women were
      recruited for the study. Data were collected using three forms including a
      questionnaire with demographic and obstetrics questions, a check-list for the
      postpartum care and education quality assessment. Control of vital signs, uterus 
      assessment, perineum assessment, leaving bed, urinary system assessment,
      digestive system assessment, breast examination, extremities assessment,
      psychological assessment, as well as education about perineum self-care,
      breast-feeding, infant care, education before discharge and educational method.
      Validity and reliability of the questionnaire and checklist were assessed prior
      to use. Data were analyzed using SPSS. FINDINGS: Results showed compatibility of 
      provided postpartum care with the standards as follows: method of patient's
      education (52.68 per cent); control of vital signs (43.21 per cent); education
      about breast-feeding (26.06 per cent); care in getting out of bed (25.83 per
      cent); psychological care (19.36 per cent); urinary system assessment (16.66 per 
      cent); education about perineum care (13.12 per cent); uterus assessment (10.6
      per cent); digestive system assessment (9.69 per cent); patient's education
      before discharge (7.99 per cent); education about infant's care (7.81 per cent); 
      perineum assessment (6.72 per cent); breast examination (1.11 per cent); and
      assessment of extremities (0.81 per cent). The study demonstrated that weak
      postpartum care was provided in 82 per cent of cases but also that mothers were
      satisfied with provided care in all domains of care. Mothers were very satisfied 
      with facilities and less satisfied with personnel interaction with their visitors
      in hospital. There was no significant correlation between quality of services and
      clients' satisfaction (Spearman test, p < 0.05). ORIGINALITY/VALUE: For the first
      time in Iran, this study has evaluated quality of care in postpartum wards of
      hospitals based on the defined standards. The study provided a defined standard
      for postpartum care, which is necessary for regular monitoring and evaluation and
      so evidence-based intervention programs to improve the system of care. It was
      also postulated that mothers' satisfaction with care is not always a good
      indicator of services quality.

TI  - A Mek1-Mek2 heterodimer determines the strength and duration of the Erk signal.
PG  - 294-303
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.1564 [doi]
AB  - Mek1 and Mek2 (also known as Map2k1 and Map2k2, respectively) are evolutionarily 
      conserved, dual-specificity kinases that mediate Erk1 and Erk2 activation during 
      adhesion and growth factor signaling. Here we describe a previously
      uncharacterized, unexpected role of Mek1 in downregulating Mek2-dependent Erk
      signaling. Mek1 mediates the regulation of Mek2 in the context of a previously
      undiscovered Mek1-Mek2 complex. The Mek heterodimer is negatively regulated by
      Erk-mediated phosphorylation of Mek1 on Thr292, a residue missing in Mek2.
      Disabling this Erk-proximal negative-feedback step stabilizes the phosphorylation
      of both Mek2 and Erk in cultured cells and in vivo in Mek1 knockout embryos and
      mice. Thus, in disagreement with the current perception of the pathway, the role 
      of Mek1 and Mek2 in growth factor-induced Erk phosphorylation is not
      interchangeable. Our data establish Mek1 as the crucial modulator of Mek and Erk 
      signaling and have potential implications for the role of Mek1 and Mek2 in
      tumorigenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of thermal history on the physical
      behavior of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), commonly used as a pharmaceutical
      excipient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rheological investigations together with SEM
      imaging and solid state analysis by XRPD and DSC were used to characterize PEG as
      starting material, as well as PEG:lactose monohydrate granules. For granulation
      experiments PEG 6000 was used and for further investigations of physicochemical
      properties, three M(w) of PEG (3000-10000) with different thermal histories
      obtained by melting the PEG followed by solidification with specific cooling
      rates. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: More uniform granules were obtained when fast
      cooled PEG was used as binder. XRPD suggested similar crystallinity for the
      different M(w) and thermal history did not influence the results drastically.
      However, rheological analysis and DSC measurements indicated different melting
      behavior dependent on the M(w) of PEG. PEG 6000 and 10000 were affected by the
      thermal treatment where stepwise melting was observed with slower cooling rate
      probably due to increased formation of extended structures. CONCLUSIONS:
      Increased cooling rate gives rise to increased randomness, more folded structure 
      of PEG, which reflects in the outcome of the granulation process.

TI  - Translation and cognitive testing of the Italian Integrated Palliative Outcome
      Scale (IPOS) among patients and healthcare professionals.
PG  - e0208536
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0208536 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outcome measurement is fundamental to assess needs and priority of
      care in palliative care settings. The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale
      (IPOS) was developed from earlier versions of this tool. Its use is encouraged to
      ameliorate the assessment of individual outcomes in palliative care settings.
      This study aimed to translate and culturally adapt IPOS into Italian, and explore
      its face and content validity. METHODS: After forward-backward translation, a
      qualitative study explored the views of and cognitive processes used by
      respondents. We conducted individual semi structured interviews with 21 patients 
      admitted to two palliative care services, from hospitals, hospices and the
      community, and focus groups with 12 professionals working in multidisciplinary
      palliative care teams and used thematic analysis. The results were integrated in 
      a final audit, including the project team and the original POS developers, to
      refine the final format of the tool. RESULTS: We conducted 21 face to face
      cognitive interviews with patients, and 2 focus groups with 14 professionals.
      Patients and professionals felt content and format of IPOS appropriate and
      feasible, and not burdensome. Some layout problems were raised leading to
      adaptation. Main issues regarded: clarifying the meaning of choices and some
      cultural interpretation of some questions and response options and interpretation
      of some instructions. We proposed using some new terms as more appropriate and
      comprehensive in our context, such as replacing the term "family" with "dear
      ones". The items that appeared unchanged from the previously validated Italian
      POS were left unmodified to maintain coherence. CONCLUSIONS: The Italian IPOS, in
      its four versions directed to patients or staff and with a recall period of 3 or 
      7 days, has face and content validity for use in clinical settings and is ready
      for further psychometric and clinimetric validation.

TI  - The pig caecum model: a suitable tool to study the intestinal metabolism of
      flavonoids.
PG  - 326-32
AB  - Pig caecum was used under anaerobic conditions to metabolize flavonoids from
      several classes, i.e., chrysin 1, naringenin 2, quercetin 3, and hesperetin 4.
      Whereas chrysin 1 was not converted by the pig intestinal flora under the
      experimental conditions used, naringenin 2 was transformed to
      3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid and 3-phenylpropionic acid. Quercetin 3 was
      metabolized to phloroglucinol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and
      3,4-dihydroxytoluene. Hesperetin 4 was degraded via eriodictyol to
      3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid and phloroglucinol. Structural elucidation of 
      the formed metabolites was performed by high-performance liquid
      chromatography--diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) as well as HPLC-electrospray
      ionization--mass spectrometry (ESI-MS (MS)) and high resolution gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS) analyses. The time course of microbial
      conversion of 2-4 was determined by HPLC-DAD analysis, revealing slow degradation
      of 2 and rapid transformation of 3 and 4. The results lead to the conclusion that
      the pig caecum model is a suitable ex vivo model for studying the intestinal
      degradation of flavonoids.

TI  - Establishment of B-cell lines latently infected with reactivation-competent
      murine gammaherpesvirus 68 provides evidence for viral alteration of a DNA
      damage-signaling cascade.
PG  - 7688-99
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02689-07 [doi]
AB  - Gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68, or MHV68) is a naturally occurring rodent
      pathogen that replicates to high titer in cell culture and is amenable to in vivo
      experimental evaluation of viral and host determinants of gammaherpesvirus
      disease. However, the inability of MHV68 to transform primary murine B cells in
      culture, the absence of a robust cell culture latency system, and the paucity of 
      MHV68-positive tumor cell lines have limited an understanding of the molecular
      mechanisms by which MHV68 modulates the host cell during latency and
      reactivation. To facilitate a more complete understanding of viral and host
      determinants that regulate MHV68 latency and reactivation in B cells, we
      generated a recombinant MHV68 virus that encodes a hygromycin resistance protein 
      fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein as a means to select cells in culture
      that harbor latent virus. We utilized this virus to infect the A20 murine mature 
      B-cell line and evaluate reactivation competence following treatment with diverse
      stimuli to reveal viral gene expression, DNA replication, and production of
      progeny virions. Comparative analyses of parental and infected A20 cells
      indicated a correlation between infection and alterations in DNA damage signaling
      following etoposide treatment. The data described in this study highlight the
      potential utility of this new cell culture-based system to dissect molecular
      mechanisms that regulate MHV68 latency and reactivation, as well as having the
      potential of illuminating biochemical alterations that contribute to
      gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. In addition, such cell lines may be of value in
      evaluating targeted therapies to gammaherpesvirus-related tumors.

TI  - Graft serosectomy in adult small bowel transplantation without vascular
      reconstruction in rats improves graft survival by induction of vascular
      endothelial growth factor.
PG  - 1881-6
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess whether adult small bowel grafts
      (ASBGs) can survive transplantation without vascular reconstruction if graft
      serosectomy (SS) is performed. METHODS: Syngeneic ASBG transplants were performed
      in 85 Lewis rats. The entire serosa was removed just before transplantation in
      the SS group (n = 50) and left intact in the nonserosectomy group (n = 35).
      Transplanted ASBG was harvested 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after
      transplantation and studied using staining with hematoxylin-eosin,
      immunohistochemistry for protein gene product 9.5, S-100, CD34 and vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and quantification of VEGF messenger RNA
      (mRNA). Adult small bowel graft viability was assessed blindly using a mucosal
      surface expansion score (0, no mucosa; 1, mucosa on one fourth of graft; 2,
      mucosa on one half of graft; 3, mucosa on three fourths of graft; and 4,
      circumferential mucosa on graft). RESULTS: No rejection was identified in any
      ASBG. Average mucosal surface expansion score and VEGF mRNA expression were
      significantly higher in the SS group (both P < .01). Vascular endothelial growth 
      factor protein was detected in enterocytes from day 3 posttransplant in the SS
      group. Distribution of protein gene product 9.5 and S-100 was normal in SS-group 
      ASBG. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SS allows VEGF mRNA and,
      subsequently, VEGF protein in ASBG to be induced very soon after transplantation,
      which may contribute to the survival of ASBG transplanted without vascular
      reconstruction.

TI  - [Hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury following kidney transplantation : a case 
      report].
PG  - 103-6
AB  - We report a case of hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury associated with
      mizoribine (MZR). A 15- year-old male with congenital renal hypoplasia underwent 
      kidney transplantation. We used tacrolimus extended release (0.15 mg/kg/day),
      mizoribine (MZR) (12 mg/kg/day), prednisolone and basiliximab as
      immunosuppressants. On the 35th post operative day, he complained of acute right 
      chest pain, right inguinal pain and dyspnea. Serum uric acid and creatinine were 
      elevated. Accordingly, we changed MZR to mycophenolate mofetil, and added
      allopurinol and potassium citrate. Gradually, the symptoms disappeared and renal 
      function was improved. In this case, prolonged MZR metabolism, hyperuricemia and 
      progressive renal dysfunction may have formed a vicious cycle. In conclusion,
      monitoring of serum uric acid level is necessary, especially when using a high
      dose MZR.

AB  - In the present Frontier article, we highlight recent new results on the use of
      platinoid complexes as therapeutic agents against Alzheimer's disease and infer
      the relevance of targeting monomeric soluble disordered amyloid peptides to
      preclude the deleterious aggregation process associated with the etiology of the 
      disease.

TI  - A comparison between total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol plus
      remifentanil and volatile induction/ maintenance of anaesthesia using sevoflurane
      in children undergoing flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy.
PG  - 742-9
AB  - Flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy is an important tool in the evaluation and
      management of paediatric respiratory disease. Total intravenous anaesthesia
      (TIVA) and volatile agent induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (VIMA) are
      commonly used for these procedures. The aim of this study was to determine which 
      is superior for children undergoing flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy.The study
      included two phases. In Phase 1, ED99 of propofol in TIVA and ED99 of sevoflurane
      in VIMA were first determined. In Phase 2, 50 children aged from one to three
      years were recruited and randomly assigned to either a TIVA or a VIMA group. An
      ED99 dose of propofol with remifentanil was administered to the TIVA group and
      sevoflurane to the VIMA group. Haemodynamic variables, stress hormone responses, 
      anaesthesia profiles, adverse reactions and physicians' levels of satisfaction
      were compared between the two groups. The ED99 values of propofol in the TIVA
      group and sevoflurane in the VIMA group were 8.9 microg/ml and 6.8% respectively.
      Haemodynamic variables and stress hormone levels were higher in the VIMA group
      than in the TIVA group. Agitation and coughing also occurred less frequently in
      the TIVA group. In addition, physicians' levels of satisfaction were greater in
      the TIVA group. Our results suggest that TIVA with propofol plus remifentanil is 
      superior to VIMA using sevoflurane alone for children undergoing flexible
      fibreoptic bronchoscopy.

TI  - Unsuccessful treatment of extragenital lichen sclerosus with topical 1%
      pimecrolimus cream.
PG  - 1014-7
AB  - Lichen sclerosus most commonly affects the anogenital region. Spreading into the 
      extragenital regions is rare, and its course is most commonly asymptomatic. Women
      have been reported to be affected 6 to 10 times more often than men. The etiology
      of lichen sclerosus is still unknown. The disease is characterized by ivory-white
      atrophic plaques, and no treatment ensuring complete recovery is available.
      T-cells are also involved in its pathogenesis. Pimecrolimus is a topical
      inhibitor of T-cells. In the present paper, we present a male patient with lichen
      sclerosus located only in extragenital regions and report an unsuccessful outcome
      of treatment with pimecrolimus 1% cream administered topically twice a day for 16
      weeks.

AB  - Poly(L-lactic acid) microspheres loaded with holmium-166 acetylacetonate
      (166Ho-PLLA-MS) are a novel microdevice for intra-arterial radio-embolization in 
      patients with unresectable liver malignancies. The neutron activation in a
      nuclear reactor, in particular the gamma heating, damages the 166Ho-PLLA-MS. The 
      degree of damage is dependent on the irradiation characteristics and irradiation 
      time in a particular reactor facility. The aim of this study was to standardize
      and objectively validate the activation procedure in a particular reactor. The
      methods included light- and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), particle size
      analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, viscometry, thermal neutron flux
      measurements and energy deposition calculations. Seven hours-neutron irradiation 
      results in sufficient specific activity of the 166Ho-PLLA-MS while structural
      integrity is preserved. Neutron flux measurements and energy deposition
      calculations are required in the screening of other nuclear reactors. For the
      evaluation of microsphere quality, light microscopy, SEM and particle size
      analysis are appropriate techniques.

AB  - Inside eukaryotic cells, macromolecules are partitioned into membrane-bounded
      compartments and, within these, some are further organized into
      non-membrane-bounded structures termed membrane-less organelles. The latter
      structures are comprised of heterogeneous mixtures of proteins and nucleic acids 
      and assemble through a phase separation phenomenon similar to polymer
      condensation. Membrane-less organelles are dynamic structures maintained through 
      multivalent interactions that mediate diverse biological processes, many involved
      in RNA metabolism. They rapidly exchange components with the cellular milieu and 
      their properties are readily altered in response to environmental cues, often
      implicating membrane-less organelles in responses to stress signaling. In this
      review, we discuss: (1) the functional roles of membrane-less organelles, (2)
      unifying structural and mechanistic principles that underlie their assembly and
      disassembly, and (3) established and emerging methods used in structural
      investigations of membrane-less organelles.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the frequency and causative
      agent(s) of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in individuals with symptoms of
      urinary tract infections in Enugu State of Southeast Nigeria, and to determine
      the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of microbial agents isolated from urine
      culture. METHODS: The study involved 211 individuals (149 females and 62 males)
      clinically suspected for UTI. Urine samples were collected by the mid-stream
      'clean catch' method and tested using standard procedures. Antibiotic
      susceptibility of the isolated pathogens was tested using the Kirby-Bauer
      technique according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
      guidelines. RESULTS: Microscopy of centrifuged urine samples showed 16 patients
      had pyuria while 54 had pus cells. Calcium oxalate crystals were found in 14
      samples. Urinalysis performed with urine samples showed 17 had protein; seven
      were nitrite positive and three had moderate to high glucose concentration.
      Fifty-four urine samples (36.2%) from females and 12 (19.4%) from males showed
      significant growth upon culture. Gram stain and biochemical tests identified nine
      different organisms with Escherichia coli as the most common isolated species.
      Forty three randomly selected strains were further tested for their
      susceptibility against a panel of antibiotics. Thirty isolates (81.08%) were
      resistant to four or more antibiotics with the highest resistance shown by E.
      coli (76.67%). All the Gram- negative isolates were resistant to Ampicilox,
      Cefuroxime and Amoxicillin. CONCLUSION: Urinary tract infections were found more 
      in females in the area under study. As found in other studies, E. coli was the
      most predominant isolate, although other organisms seem to be on the increase.

      leading to overload of the pulmonary circulation and low systemic blood flow.
      These hemodynamic anomalies are associated with a higher incidence of
      respiratory, neurological, and digestive complications of prematurity, as well as
      a higher mortality rate. Although growing knowledge about the natural history,
      the pathophysiology, and the mechanisms of closure of the ductus arteriosus has
      resulted in therapeutic progress, management of the patent ductus arteriosus in
      the preterm infant is still a subject of intense controversy. We describe here
      the different treatment modalities, their benefits and side effects, and the
      therapeutic strategies that have been tested in the last four decades. Based on
      this evidence, the current trend is a personalized approach to the patent ductus 
      arteriosus, adapted to each preterm infant's individual characteristics and risk 
      factors.

TI  - Secondary ion MS imaging of lipids in picoliter vials with a buckminsterfullerene
      ion source.
PG  - 6190-6
AB  - Investigation of the spatial distribution of lipids in cell membranes can lead to
      an improved understanding of the role of lipids in biological function and
      disease. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is capable of
      molecule-specific imaging of biological molecules across single cells and has
      demonstrated potential for examining the functional segregation of lipids in cell
      membranes. In this paper, standard SIMS spectra are analyzed for
      phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine,
      phosphatidylinositol, cholesterol, and sulfatide. Importantly, each of the lipids
      result in signature mass spectral peaks that allow them to be identified. These
      signature peaks are also useful for imaging experiments and are utilized here to 
      simultaneously image lipids on a micrometer scale in picoliter vials. Because the
      low secondary ion signal achieved for lipids from an atomic primary ion source
      makes cell-imaging experiments challenging, improving signal with cluster primary
      ion sources is of interest. Here, we compare the secondary ion yield for seven
      lipids using atomic (Ga+ or In+) ion sources and a buckminsterfullerene (C60+)
      primary ion source. A 40-1000-fold improvement in signal is found with C60+
      relative to the other two ion sources, indicating great promise for future
      cellular imaging applications using the C60+ probe.

TI  - DFT investigation on dihydrogen-bonded amine-borane complexes.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1007/s00894-015-2886-8 [doi]
AB  - The DFT method has been employed in the exploration on dihydrogen-bonded
      amine-borane complexes, with a special emphasis on the dimerization and
      substituent group effect. Stable dihydrogen bonded complexes can be generated
      from these amine-borane monomers with the appearance of NH(delta+)...H(delta-)B
      interactions. The binding energy decreases gradually with the increase of the
      steric effect of the substituents. The substituent group number mainly varies the
      C-N bond length. The dimerization generates close H...H and influences
      predominantly the N-B distance. The effect of dimerization on IR and vibrational 
      circular dichroism (VCD) spectra is stronger than that of the number of
      substituent groups, which leads to distinct NBO charge variation on alpha-C. Both
      the substituent group number and dimerization enhance the chemical shift
      difference between hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to N and B, Deltadelta H-H,
      which can be hired as an index for structural determination. It is proposed that 
      amine-borane complexes with more substituent groups in higher degree of
      polymerization are potentially interesting materials for hydrogen storage.
      Graphical Abstract Both the number of substituent group and dimerization enhance 
      the chemical shift difference of hydrogen atoms covalently bonded on N and B,
      Deltadelta H-H, which can be employed as an index for the structural
      determination.

TI  - Stimulation of IgY responses in gene gun immunized laying hens by combined
      administration of vector DNA coding for the target antigen Botulinum toxin A1 and
      for avian cytokine adjuvants.
PG  - 58-67
LID - 10.1016/j.jim.2012.05.005 [doi]
AB  - DNA immunization is a convenient and effective way of inducing a specific
      antibody response. In mammals, co-administration of vectors encoding
      immunostimulatory cytokines can enhance the humoral response resulting in
      elevated antibody titers. We therefore set out to investigate the effect using
      avian interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and avian interleukin 6 (IL-6) as genetic
      adjuvants when immunizing laying hens. A BoNT A1 holotoxoid DNA immunogen
      carrying two inactivating mutations was evaluated for its ability to induce a
      specific and sustained IgY antibody response. Both the holotoxoid and the
      cytokine sequences were codon-optimized. In vitro, the proteins were efficiently 
      expressed in transfected HEK 293T cells and the cytokines were secreted into the 
      culture supernatants. Whereas eggs from hens immunized via gene gun using a prime
      boost strategy showed no differences in their total IgY content, the specific
      alphaBoNT A1 response was slightly elevated up to 1.4x by the IL-1beta adjuvant
      vector and increased by 3.8x by the IL-6 vector. Finally, although hens receiving
      the IL-1beta adjuvant had laying capacities above the average, hens receiving the
      IL-6 adjuvant experienced laying problems.

PG  - 449-55

AB  - With several small series examining minimally invasive Ivor Lewis
      esophagectomies, we look to contribute to a growing experience. In reporting our 
      initial results, safety, initial oncologic completeness, and preliminary outcomes
      with a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy were demonstrated. From 2007
      to 2010, 40 minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomies were carried out. The
      approach was a laparoscopic mobilization of the stomach and a thoracoscopic
      esophageal mobilization and creation of a high intrathoracic anastomosis.
      Indications included esophageal cancer in 39 patients and esophageal
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor in one patient. Median age was 62 (range 39-77)
      with 31 (78%) male patients. Non-emergent conversion was required in two (5%)
      patients. Twenty-five (63%) patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy. Mean
      operative time was 364 minutes (range 285-455), and mean blood loss was 205 cc
      (range 100-400). All patients underwent an R0 resection including the removal of 
      all Barrett's esophagus, and mean number of nodes harvested was 21 (range 11-41).
      Median intensive care unit stay was 1 day (range 1-3), and hospital stay was 7
      days (range 6-19). There were no anastomotic leaks and no 30-day mortality.
      Postoperative complications included eight (21%) patients with atrial
      fibrillation and two (5%) chylothorax, one requiring ligation. At a mean
      follow-up of 16.5 months (range 1-39 months), five (13%) patients have had a
      distant recurrence; there have been no local recurrences. Minimally invasive Ivor
      Lewis esophagectomy, although technically challenging, can be carried out with
      reasonable operative times, a short length of stay, and minimal complication.
      Final oncologic validity is pending longer follow-up and a larger series.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is impaired in diabetic rat
      liver.
PG  - 848-56
LID - 10.1002/jcb.23413 [doi]
AB  - Using a streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rat model, we analyzed and
      separated the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia over the in vivo
      expression and subcellular localization of hepatic fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase
      (FBPase) in the multicellular context of the liver. Our data showed that FBPase
      subcellular localization was modulated by the nutritional state in normal but not
      in diabetic rats. By contrast, the liver zonation was not affected in any
      condition. In healthy starved rats, FBPase was localized in the cytoplasm of
      hepatocytes, whereas in healthy re-fed rats it was concentrated in the nucleus
      and the cell periphery. Interestingly, despite the hyperglycemia, FBPase was
      unable to accumulate in the nucleus in hepatocytes from streptozotocin-induced
      diabetic rats, suggesting that insulin is a critical in vivo modulator. This idea
      was confirmed by exogenous insulin supplementation to diabetic rats, where
      insulin was able to induce the rapid accumulation of FBPase within the hepatocyte
      nucleus. Besides, hepatic FBPase was found phosphorylated only in the cytoplasm, 
      suggesting that the phosphorylation state is involved in the nuclear
      translocation. In conclusion, insulin and not hyperglycemia plays a crucial role 
      in the nuclear accumulation of FBPase in vivo and may be an important regulatory 
      mechanism that could account for the increased endogenous glucose production of
      liver of diabetic rodents.

TI  - Thiol/disulphide homeostasis in schizophrenia patients with positive symptoms.
PG  - 281-284
LID - 10.1080/08039488.2018.1441906 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aims to investigate the dynamic thiol/disulphincide
      homeostasis in patients with schizophrenia who have positive psychotic
      indications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients (26 males, 18 females;
      mean age = 34.40 +/- 8.98 years) accepted at the Department of Psychiatry of the 
      Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital and 33 healthy controls (15 males,
      18 females; mean age of 30.30 +/- 8.48 years) were included in the study. Serum
      native thiol and total thiol were measured with a novel colorimetric, automated
      method. The disulfide levels and disulfide/native thiol ratios were also
      calculated from these measured parameters. RESULTS: Serum native thiol and the
      total thiol concentration were significantly lower in schizophrenia compared with
      the control group (p < .05). Disulphide levels and disulfide/native thiol ratios 
      were significantly higher in schizophrenia compared with the control group (p <
      .05). When the patients were divided into two groups according to those who used 
      medication and those who did not for the last two months, it was found to be
      significantly higher in those who used disulfide and disulfide/native thiol
      medication than those who did not use medication. CONCLUSION: The
      disulfide/native thiol ratio in patients with schizophrenia who have been using
      medication for the last 2 months has been found to be significantly higher than
      controls who have not been using medication, may be indicating that the level of 
      native thiol does not increase in a correlation as high as the increase in
      disulfide levels. It demonstrates that thiol/disulfide equilibrium has shifted
      towards the disulfide. The excess disulfide amounts might associated with both
      disease itself and the using medication.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most important childhood cancer. Multidrug
      resistance is an important factor of poor prognosis. We present the
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity in 2 patients with different outcomes. Both
      patients had B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; they were responding properly
      to the treatment, but one of them had an increment in the P-gp activity that
      correlates with an increment in the disease manifestation, the patient had to be 
      hospitalized and developed sepsis and subsequently died. P-gp levels were
      correlated with disease progression. P-gp activity needs to be evaluated during
      treatment to assess and prevent disease relapse or the patient s death.

TI  - Irreversibly binding anti-metal chelate antibodies: Artificial receptors for
      pretargeting.
PG  - 882-90
AB  - Antibodies against metal chelates may potentially be used in biomedical
      applications such as targeted imaging and therapy of cancer. Highly specific
      monoclonal antibodies can be developed, but their binding strength needs to be
      maximized for them to be of practical use. In general, the half-life for
      dissociation of an antibody-ligand complex is more than an order of magnitude
      lower than the half-lifetimes for decay of medically useful radiometal ions.
      Practically speaking, the metal chelate-based ligand will not be bound to its
      receptor long enough for all of the bound radiometal to decay. A novel approach
      to this problem is a combination of synthetic chemistry and site-directed
      mutagenesis, to position a mildly reactive group on the metal chelate adjacent to
      a complementary reactive group on the antibody when the complex is formed. The
      partners are chosen to be sufficiently unreactive so that they coexist with other
      molecules in living systems without undergoing reaction. When the
      antibody-chelate complex is formed the effective local concentrations of the two 
      groups can be non-physically large, so that a permanent link is formed in the
      complex even though no reaction occurs when the partners are free in solution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Constipation is a prodromal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and
      the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. However,
      no studies have demonstrated ante-mortem relationships between nigrostriatal
      dysfunction and GI dysautonomia in PD. METHODS: The Scale for Outcomes in
      Parkinson's disease for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT) assesses dysautonomia in
      the multi-center Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). We used linear
      mixed-effects models and reliable change indices (RCIs) to examine longitudinal
      associations between dysautonomia and dopamine transporter (DAT) striatal binding
      ratios (SBRs) measured by single-photon emission computerized tomography in PPMI 
      participants over four years (n=397at baseline). RESULTS: Adjusted mixed-models
      of longitudinal data showed that constipation-but not orthostatic hypotension or 
      urinary dysfunction-was associated with reduced SBR in both caudate (P<0.001) and
      putamen (P=0.040). In both regions, SBR reductions between baseline and 4-year
      follow-up were significant and measurable (P<0.0001), with larger decline and
      variance in the caudate nucleus. Four-year change in caudate-but not
      putaminal-SBR was significantly associated with RCI-indicated progression of GI
      dysautonomia (P=0.031), but not other types of dysautonomia. These associations
      remained after adjusting for the use of medications or supplements to control
      constipation. Consistent with prior PPMI reports, motor impairment progression
      was not associated with SBR reduction. CONCLUSIONS: GI dysautonomia correlates
      with reductions in DAT availability; constipation is most closely associated with
      caudate-DAT reduction. Worsening GI-dysautonomia and reduced bowel movements may 
      accompany advancing nigral degeneration or changes in nigrostriatal dopamine
      function.

AB  - The minor cerebrosides from a Far-Eastern glass sponge Aulosaccus sp. were
      analyzed as constituents of some multi-component RP-HPLC fractions. The
      structures of eighteen new and one known cerebrosides were elucidated on the
      basis of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, optical rotation data and chemical 
      transformations. These beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->1)-ceramides contain sphingoid 
      bases N-acylated with straight-chain (2R)-2-hydroxy fatty acids, namely,
      (2S,3S,4R,11Z)-2-aminoeicos-11-ene-1,3,4-triol, acylated with 15E-22:1, 16Z-21:1,

      (2S,3S,4R)-2-aminohexadecane-1,3,4-triol, attached to 15Z-22:1 acid. The
      13-methyl and 9-methyl-branched trihydroxy sphingoid base backbones (C15 and C17,
      respectively) have not been found previously in sphingolipids. The ceramide
      parts, containing other backbones, present new variants of N-acylation of the
      marine sphingoid bases with the 2-hydroxy fatty acids. The combination of the
      instrumental and chemical methods used in this study improved the efficiency of
      the structural analysis of such complex cerebroside mixtures that gave more
      detailed information on glycosphingolipid metabolism of the organism.

AB  - In comparison to herbaceous plants, studies of cold responsive genes and cold
      signaling in woody perennials are limited. Since most woody plants have evolved
      freezing tolerance (FT) in winter, together with similar lignified structures and
      winter adaptive mechanisms, it is more likely to find cold resistant genes in
      woody plants growing in temperate and arctic regions. In this study,
      Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an evergreen, broadleaf and leguminous shrub was
      selected as a model to study cold tolerance in woody plants. Thirteen cold
      up-regulated cDNAs (including eight full-length cDNAs and five partial cDNAs)
      were cloned from A. mongolicus. One of these genes, AmEBP1, confers enhanced cold
      tolerance to E. coli and obvious increased freezing survival to Arabidopsis. In
      transgenic Arabidopsis expressing AmEBP1, transcript levels of some downstream
      genes in cold signaling exhibit increased accumulation upon cold treatment.
      Together with structural information, sub-cellular location, and promoter
      analysis data, it is suggested that AmEBP1 enhances plants cold tolerance by
      accelerating ribosome biogenesis and the concomitant translation of cold induced 
      transcription factors and downstream protective proteins under cold stress.

      obstructive pulmonary disease based on canonical correlation analysis.
PG  - 121-134
LID - 10.3233/THC-174257 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disorder
      with a high mortality. The pathophysiology of COPD has not been characterized
      till date. OBJECTIVE: To identify COPD-related biomarkers by a bioinformatics
      analysis. METHODS: Here, we conducted the canonical correlation analysis to
      extract the potential COPD-related miRNAs and mRNAs based on the miRNA-mRNA dual 
      expression profiling data. After identifying miRNAs and mRNAs related to COPD, we
      constructed an interaction network by integrating three validated miRNA-target
      sources. Then we expanded the network by adding miRNA-mRNA pairs, which were
      identified by Spearman rank correlation test. For miRNAs involved in the network,
      we further performed the Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis of
      their targets. To validate COPD-related mRNAs involved in the network, we
      performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Support
      Vector Machine (SVM) classification on only those mRNAs that overlapped with
      COPD-related mRNAs of Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database.
      RESULTS: The results indicate that some identified miRNAs and their targets in
      the constructed network might be potential biomarkers of COPD. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study helps us to predict the potential risk biomarkers of COPD, and it can
      certainly help in further elucidating the genetic etiology of COPD.

AB  - A-type lamins are components of the lamina network at the nuclear envelope, which
      mediates nuclear stiffness and anchors chromatin to the nuclear periphery.
      However, A-type lamins are also found in the nuclear interior. Here we review the
      roles of the chromatin-associated, nucleoplasmic LEM protein, lamina-associated
      polypeptide 2alpha (LAP2alpha) in the regulation of A-type lamins in the nuclear 
      interior. The lamin A/C-LAP2alpha complex may be involved in the regulation of
      the retinoblastoma protein-mediated pathway and other signaling pathways
      balancing proliferation and differentiation, and in the stabilization of
      higher-order chromatin organization throughout the nucleus. Loss of LAP2alpha in 
      mice leads to selective depletion of the nucleoplasmic A-type lamin pool,
      promotes the proliferative stem cell phenotype of tissue progenitor cells, and
      delays stem cell differentiation. These findings support the hypothesis that
      LAP2alpha and nucleoplasmic lamins are regulators of adult stem cell function and
      tissue homeostasis. Finally, we discuss potential implications of this concept
      for defining the molecular disease mechanisms of lamin-linked diseases such as
      muscular dystrophy and premature aging syndromes.

TI  - Vagolytic atropine attenuates cerebral vasodilation response during acute
      orthostatic hypotension.
PG  - 594-602
LID - 10.4097/kjae.2015.68.6.594 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atropine is an anticholinergic drug which is commonly used in
      clinical practice. The effect of parasympathetic block with atropine on dynamic
      cerebrovascular regulation remains unclear. This study was aimed to identify
      effects of vagolytic atropine on cerebrovascular response during acute
      orthostatic hypotension in humans. METHODS: Continuous middle cerebral blood flow
      velocity (CBFV, transcranial Doppler) and arterial blood pressure (ABP,
      Finometer) were measured during a sit-to-stand procedure in 10 healthy subjects
      with placebo and vagolytic (10 microg/kg) doses of atropine. Cerebral vascular
      tone was assessed by cerebrovascular resistance (CVR = ABP / CBFV). Dynamic
      cerebral autoregulation was also assessed by transfer function analysis of ABP
      and CBFV. RESULTS: During the standing session, ABP fell to a similar extent in
      both groups by an average of 23 to 25 mmHg (26% to 29%). CBFV also fell in all
      subjects but significantly more in vagolytic atropine (-15.0 +/- 7.0 cm/s)
      compared with placebo (-12.0 +/- 5.8 cm/s, P < 0.05). CVR was decreased
      significantly in the placebo group during posture change (1.56 +/- 0.44 vs. 1.38 
      +/- 0.38, P < 0.05), in contrast, lesser decreased in the atropine group (1.60
      +/- 0.50 vs. 1.53 +/- 0.42, P = 0.193). Transfer function coherence in the
      very-low-frequency range was significantly increased in the atropine group during
      the standing session (0.55 +/- 0.14), compared with the sitting session (0.45 +/-
      0.14, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: These data present that vagolytic atropine
      attenuates cerebral vasodilation response to acute orthostatic hypotension,
      suggesting the use of atropine may need care in patients with cerebrovascular
      disease with vagal impairment.

PG  - 413-6
AB  - The analysis on the balance of nutrient's profit and loss in crop-fruit
      ecosystems of three villges in middle-south Loess Plateau showed that
      fertilization was the main input of nutrients, of which, chemical fertilizer
      occupied a larger proportion, while organic manure was relatively insufficient.

AB  - Insufficient capacity to use evidence-based programs (EBPs) limits the impact of 
      community-based organizations (CBOs) to improve population health and address
      health disparities. PLANET MassCONECT was a community-based participatory
      research (CBPR) project conducted in three Massachusetts communities. Researchers
      and practitioners co-created an intervention to build capacity among CBO staff
      members to systematically find, adapt, and evaluate EBPs. The project supported
      development of trainee social networks and this cross-sectional study examines
      the association between network engagement and EBP usage, an important goal of
      the capacity-building program. Trainee cohorts were enrolled from June 2010 to
      April 2012 and we collected community-specific network data in late 2013. The
      relationship of interest was communication among network members regarding the
      systematic approach to program planning presented in the intervention. For
      Communities A, B, and C, 39/59, 36/61, and 50/59 trainees responded to our
      survey, respectively. We conducted the full network analysis in Community C. The 
      average degree, or number of connections with other trainees, is a useful marker 
      of engagement; respondents averaged 6.6 reported connections. Degree was
      associated with recent use of EBPs, in a linear regression, adjusting for
      important covariates. The results call for further attention to practitioner
      networks that support the use of research evidence in community settings.
      Consideration of key contextual factors, including resource levels, turnover
      rates, and community complexity will be vital for success.

TI  - New applications of the mathematical model of a permeation passive sampler:
      prediction of the effective uptake rate and storage stability.
PG  - 113-123
LID - 10.1039/c8em00397a [doi]
AB  - As the applications of passive sampling in environmental analysis are increasing,
      it is crucial to ensure that the methods applied in the measurement of pollutant 
      concentrations provide sufficient accuracy in compliance with existing
      regulations. Additionally, as with any sampling method in an analytical process, 
      sample integrity is essential for accurate determination of contaminants and
      their concentrations. In a recent study, a mathematical model was developed to
      describe the sampling process in permeation passive samplers. The model was able 
      to predict the significance of potential uptake rate changes during sampling. The
      model also predicted the distribution of the sampled analyte within the different
      compartments of the sampler. In the present work, the model was extended to
      include two practical applications. In the first part, a novel method allowing
      prediction of the effective uptake rate of the sampler is presented. The method
      accounts for changes in the uptake rate during the exposure time caused by
      resistance to mass transfer in the sorbent bed, allowing accurate calculation of 
      the time weighted average concentrations. The method was proven to be successful 
      through experimental verification that involved sampling toluene and
      trichloroethylene using the Waterloo Membrane Sampler (WMS). In the second part, 
      the post-sampling storage period of analytes in the WMS was evaluated. It was
      found both theoretically and experimentally that analyzing the sorbent only is
      sufficient to quantify the analytes collected, as the amount retained in the
      remaining compartments of the sampler (PDMS membrane, air inside the sampler and 
      the storage vial) is negligible after sampling. The amounts of analytes collected
      by the sorbent were stable over up to three-weeks of storage at room temperature.
      These findings establish confidence in the use of the WMS for sampling Volatile
      Organic Compounds (VOCs).

TI  - H3K27me3 may be associated with Oct4 and Sox2 in mouse preimplantation embryos.
PG  - 10121-9
LID - 10.4238/2014.December.4.6 [doi]
AB  - As a core member of polycomb repressive complex 2, the transcription and enzyme
      activity of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) is directly involved in the
      trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3. In this study, the fluorescence
      intensity of H3K27me3 in mouse in vivo morulae and blastocysts was compared by
      indirect immunofluorescence staining. We found that demethylation of H3K27me3
      occurred during the blastocyst stage. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was
      performed to investigate Ezh2 expression in oocytes and in preimplantation
      embryos. Ezh2 expression peaked during the zygote stage and gradually decreased
      from the 2-cell stage, exhibiting an inverse pattern when compared with Oct4 and 
      Sox2 mRNA in mouse preimplantation embryos. To understand the role of
      development-related genes on the transcription of mouse Ezh2, a promoter assay
      was performed in NIH/3T3 cells. Ezh2 expression was markedly suppressed by Oct4
      and Sox2 alone in a dose-dependent manner, while Ezh2 promoter activity in
      co-transfection with Nanog, Klf-4, and c-Myc groups showed no significant change 
      as compared with the control. Our data suggest that the demethylation of H3K27me3
      is caused by the degressive expression and activity of Ezh2 in blastocysts,
      leading to increased expression of developmentally important transcription
      factors. We also observed negative effects of Oct4 and Sox2 on the transcription 
      of Ezh2 and identified Oct4 and Sox2 as novel negative regulators of Ezh2 at the 
      post-translation level in a mouse preimplantation embryo.

      Social Networks of LGBTQ Youth.
LID - E1078 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15061078 [doi]
AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth and young adults
      almost inevitably "come out", or self-disclose their identity to others. Some
      LGBTQ youth are more uniformly "out", while others may disclose to some groups
      but not others. This selective disclosure is complicated on real name social
      media sites, which tend to encourage a unified presentation of self across social
      contexts. We explore these complications with a cohort of LBGTQ youth on Facebook
      (N = 199, Mage = 24.13). Herein we ask: How do LBGTQ youth manage the disclosure 
      of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity to different people in their
      lives? Further, are there identifiable differences in the online social network
      structure for LGBTQ youth who manage outness in different ways? Finally, how do
      LGBTQ young people describe their experiences on Facebook? We answer these
      questions using a mixed methods approach, combining statistical cluster analysis,
      network visualization, and qualitative data. Our findings illustrate patterns in 
      network structure by outness cluster type, highlighting both the work involved in
      managing one's online identity as well as the costs to (semi-) closeted
      individuals including a considerably lower overall network connectivity. In
      particular, outness to family characterized LGBTQ young people's experiences on
      Facebook.

TI  - The oblique effect and three-dimensional shape.
PG  - 80-83
AB  - The classical oblique effect refers to the finding that observers are faster and 
      more accurate in discriminating the orientation of a line or edge when it is at
      or near vertical or horizontal than when it is at an oblique orientation
      (Appelle, 1972; Mach, 1861). Based on the finding that observer sensitivity to
      orientation of simple symmetric shapes like an ellipse or the letter "X" also
      exhibits an oblique effect, Li and Westheimer (1997) suggested that the effect
      does not arise solely from inequality of simple orientation-tuned receptors in
      early visual processing, but also involves later orientation processing that can 
      encompass more complex inputs such as shape axes. In this work, we examined how
      the oblique effect impacts three-dimensional shapes defined by texture cues.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A greater irrigant volume improves the effectiveness of root canal 
      irrigation. The purpose of this study was to compare 2 negative pressure systems 
      regarding the volume of irrigant collected from the apical area in moderately
      curved canals at 3 different flow rates of delivery in vitro. METHODS: The
      mesiobuccal canals of 30 molars with a curvature between 20 degrees and 40
      degrees were prepared to size #40.04 taper. A closed system was created. The
      canals were irrigated at 3, 6, and 12 mL/min for 30 seconds using EndoVac
      (SybronEndo, Orange, CA) and the INP needle (Mixnus Fine Engineering Co Ltd,
      Nagano, Japan) (both independent variables). A recovery trap was used to collect 
      the irrigant aspirated by the negative pressure needles. Irrigant volume
      (dependent variable) was measured in milliliters. Data were analyzed using mixed 
      analysis of variance. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant interaction 
      between the negative pressure system and the irrigant volume collected (P <
      .0005). The mean irrigant volume collected by the different negative pressure
      systems was greater for INP at 3 (P < .001), 6 (P < .001), and 12 mL/min (P <
      .001) flow rate. Both negative pressure needles showed statistically significant 
      differences (P < .001) between mean irrigant volume collected at different flow
      rates. CONCLUSIONS: A greater volume was collected by increasing the flow rate of
      irrigant delivery for both EndoVac and INP. The INP needle could collect a
      greater volume of irrigant from the apical third compared with EndoVac at all 3
      different flow rates.

TI  - Hyperaccumulation of Pb, Zn and Cd in herbaceous grown on lead-zinc mining area
      in Yunnan, China.
PG  - 755-62
AB  - A field survey of herbaceous growing on lead-zinc mining area in Yunnan, China
      were conducted to identify species accumulating exceptionally large
      concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd in shoots. In total, 220 plant samples of 129
      species of 50 families and 220 soil samples in which the plants were growing were
      collected. According to accumulation concentration in plant shoots and the
      concentration time levels compared to plants from non-polluted environments, 21
      plant samples of 16 species were chosen as best-performing specimens, 11 plant
      samples of 10 species for Pb, 5 plant samples of 4 species for Zn and 5 plant
      samples of 5 species for Cd. Sonchus asper (L.) Hill in Qilinkeng had
      hyperaccumulation capacity to Pb and Zn. Corydalis pterygopetala Franch in
      Paomaping had hyperaccumulation capacity to Zn and Cd. All 5 Cd hyperaccumulators
      came from Lanping lead-zinc mining area. Out of 11 Pb hyperaccumulators, 7 came
      from Minbingying of Huice lead-zinc mining area. The average of the concentration
      time levels compared to plants from non-polluted environments were higher than 10
      times in all plant samples, the concentration time levels changed from 203 times 
      to 620 times for Pb, from 50 times to 70 times for Zn and from 145 times to 330
      times for Cd. Out of 21 plant samples, translocation factor changed from 0.35 to 
      1.90, only translocation factor of 7 plant samples were higher than 1. Enrichment
      coefficients of all samples were lower than 1. These plant species were primarily
      heavy metal hyperaccumulator, and will be used in phytoremediation of the
      metallic pollutants in soils after further research in accumulation mechanism.

TI  - Differential azole antifungal efficacies contrasted using a Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae strain humanized for sterol 14 alpha-demethylase at the homologous
      locus.
PG  - 3597-603
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00517-08 [doi]
AB  - Inhibition of sterol-14 alpha-demethylase, a cytochrome P450 (CYP51, Erg11p), is 
      the mode of action of azole antifungal drugs, and with high frequencies of fungal
      infections new agents are required. New drugs that target fungal CYP51 should not
      inhibit human CYP51, although selective inhibitors of the human target are also
      of interest as anticholesterol agents. A strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that 
      was humanized with respect to the amino acids encoded at the CYP51 (ERG11) yeast 
      locus (BY4741:huCYP51) was produced. The strain was validated with respect to
      gene expression, protein localization, growth characteristics, and sterol
      content. The MIC was determined and compared to that for the wild-type parental
      strain (BY4741), using clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, itraconazole,
      ketoconazole, miconazole, and voriconazole. The humanized strain showed up to
      >1,000-fold-reduced susceptibility to the orally active azole drugs, while the
      topical agents showed no difference. Data from growth kinetic measurements
      substantiated this finding but also revealed reduced effectiveness against the
      humanized strain for the topical drugs. Cellular sterol profiles reflected the
      decreased susceptibility of BY4741:huCYP51 and showed a smaller depletion of
      ergosterol and accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl-ergosta-8, 24(28)-dien-3beta-6
      alpha-diol than the parental strain under the same treatment conditions. This
      strain provides a useful tool for initial specificity testing for new drugs
      targeting CYP51 and clearly differentiates azole antifungals in a side-by-side
      comparison.

AB  - Tests of canine cognition are now receiving much deserved attention. Not only are
      dogs excellent models for human anxiety-related conditions and those involving
      brain aging, but how dogs learn and problem solve are interesting stand-alone
      topics. A number of factors can affect learning at the molecular level including 
      stress or distress, factors that affect olfaction, effects of breed and
      nutritional factors including that may affect available brain energy. This review
      provides an overview of how these factors may affect baseline learning and brain 
      aging.

TI  - Integrated sample preparation methodology for proteomics: analysis of native
      proteins.
PG  - 8039-45
LID - 10.1021/ac401477w [doi]
AB  - An innovative sample preparation strategy is reported for protein identification 
      in complex mixtures based on integration of affinity chromatographic selection
      and accelerated trypsin digestion using a continuous flow immobilized enzyme
      reactor (cf-IMER). Affinity selected glycoproteins were released to a cf-IMER
      column which converted native proteins to peptides in 5 min at elevated
      temperature. Digestion with the cf-IMER was compared to the traditional 16 h
      solution-based trypsin digestion of reduced and alkylated proteins. With
      immobilized antibody selection of Lewis x (Le(x)) glycan bearing glycoproteins
      from plasma, 66 proteins were identified in total with the two methods while
      approximately 1/3 of the total proteins and peptides were only observed with the 
      cf-IMER. This suggests that proteomics based on protein identification by
      reduction and alkylation with solution-based trypsin digestion alone may not be
      identifying large numbers of proteins or peptides present at detectable levels in
      samples. Furthermore, except for proteins containing a high content of disulfide 
      bonds, the majority of proteins did not require reduction and alkylation steps
      for their identification. The validity of the proposed proteolysis was evaluated 
      in several ways by analyses of a model protein and yeast lysates where the
      reproducibility of quantification was essentially the same with both cf-IMER and 
      solution-based proteolysis.

AB  - A simulated oxidation technique was used to examine the impacts of degradation on
      the surface properties of biochar and the potential implications of the changes
      in biochar properties were discussed. To simulate the short- and long-term
      environmental degradation, mild and harsh degradation were employed. Results
      showed that after mild degradation, the biochar samples showed significant
      reductions in surface area and pore volumes. After harsh degradation, the biochar
      samples revealed dramatic variations in their surface chemistry, surface area,
      pore volumes, morphology and adsorption properties. The results clearly indicate 
      that changes of biochar surface properties were affected by biochar types and
      oxidative conditions. It is suggested that biochar surface properties are likely 
      to be gradually altered during environmental exposure. This implies that these
      changes have potential effects for altering the physicochemical properties of
      biochar amended soils.

TI  - Use of statins and risk of hospitalization with dementia: a Danish
      population-based case-control study.

AB  - Several epidemiologic studies have indicated reduced risk of dementia among users
      of statins. We assessed the risk of hospitalization with dementia associated with
      use of statins in a population-based case-control study in 4 Northern Danish
      counties in the period 1991 to 2005. We identified 11,039 cases with dementia and
      110,340 age- matched and sex-matched population controls using data from the
      National Patient Registry, the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, and the Civil
      Registration System. Prescriptions for statins filled before the admission for
      dementia were identified using population-based prescription databases. We used
      conditional logistic regression analysis to compute relative risk of
      hospitalization with dementia associated with use of statins using nonusers as
      reference group. We found an overall reduced risk of hospitalization with
      dementia among statin users (adjusted odds ratio: 0.67, 95% confidence intervals:
      0.60-0.75). The reduced risk associated with statin use remained robust in
      various subanalyses, however, we found no clear dose-response pattern between the
      number of filled prescriptions for statin and the risk of hospitalization with
      dementia. In conclusion, we found a reduced risk of hospitalization with dementia
      among users of statins, however, whether this association is causal remains to be
      clarified.

AB  - Endocannabinoids (eCBs) and acylethanolamides (AEs) have lately received more
      attention due to their neuroprotective functions in neurological disorders. Here 
      we analyze the alterations induced by perinatal asphyxia (PA) in the main
      metabolic enzymes and receptors of the eCBs/AEs in the dorsal striatum of rats.
      To induce PA, we used a model developed by Bjelke et al. (1991).
      Immunohistochemical techniques were carried out to determine the expression of
      neuronal and glial markers (NeuN and GFAP), eCBs/AEs synthesis and degradation
      enzymes (DAGLalpha, NAPE-PLD and FAAH) and their receptors (CB1 and PPARalpha).
      We found a decrease in NAPE-PLD and PPARalpha expression. Since NAPE-PLD and
      PPARalpha take part in the production and reception of biochemical actions of
      AEs, such as oleoylethanolamide, these results may suggest that PA plays a key
      role in the regulation of this system. These data agree with previous results
      obtained in the hippocampus and encourage us to develop further studies using AEs
      as potential neuroprotective compounds.

AB  - This article reports the removal of several emerging contaminants (ECs) from
      water using novel adsorbent comprising of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) coated on
      silica. Fourteen different adsorbents were synthesized under different
      experimental conditions using two different crosslinking agents (hexamethylene
      diisocyanate (HMDI) and epichlorohydrin (EPI)) and co-polymers (glycidoxypropyl
      trimethoxysilane (GPTS) and aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES). The adsorption
      capacities of the synthesized adsorbents were initially evaluated using
      17beta-estradiol, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and bisphenol-A (BPA) as
      adsorbates. The adsorbent prepared by using HMDI as crosslinking agent with DMSO 
      as solvent was observed to perform the best, and removed more than 90% of
      17beta-estradiol, PFOA, and BPA. Furthermore, the beta-CD loading on the ECs
      removal was studied which showed that the adsorbate removal increases with
      increase in loading of beta-CD on the substrate. The best adsorbent was
      resynthesized in seven batches and its performance was reproducible for the
      removal of ten steroid hormones. The adsorbent showed very good regeneration
      potential for four successive adsorption-regeneration cycles to remove steroid
      hormones and PFOA. A plausible mechanism of adsorption is proposed. The
      synthesized best adsorbent is characterized using FTIR, HR-TEM, TGA and nitrogen 
      adsorption analysis. The TGA results showed that the adsorbent has thermal
      stability of upto 300 degrees C.

      was weaned from hemodialysis after combination therapy with steroid and
      plasmapheresis].
PG  - 887-92
AB  - We report an anti-GBM antibody-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis patient who
      benefitted from maintenance hemodialysis 4 months after the initial treatment,
      which included steroid pulse therapy and plasma exchange. A-29-year-old male was 
      referred to our hospital because of high fever, abnormal urinary findings
      (leukocytes 3+, protein 2+, occult blood 3+) and a moderate degree of
      azotemia(S-Cr 2.9 mg/dl). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 18.9 mg/dl and antibiotics
      were administered intravenously for 7 days under the diagnosis of pyelonephritis.
      High fever persisted, however, and S-Cr increased to 9.2 mg/dl even though a
      sufficient volume of urine was maintained. Blood and urine cultures were negative
      for bacteria. A kidney biopsy was performed and cellular crescents were observed 
      around the glomeruli. No abnormal finding was observed in the lung and the
      nasopharyngeal region. To treat the crescentic glomerulonephritis, steroid and
      cyclophosphamide were administered while hemodialysis was carried out
      simultaneously. Although P-ANCA and C-ANCA were negative, anti-GBM antibody was
      proven to be positive thereafter (169 U) and six sessions of plasmapheresis were 
      additionally performed to remove the antibody. Two months after the last
      plasmapheresis, the reduced urine volume (300 ml/day) gradually returned to
      normal. Hemodialysis was terminated because the S-Cr concentration reached a
      plateau at 4 mg/dl. Repeated biopsy revealed marked glomerulosclerosis, hence
      hypertension treatment and a low protein diet were ordered. In conclusion,
      residual renal function might improve even after 4 months of hemodialysis in
      cases of intensively treated anti-GBM-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis,
      though consecutive renoprotective therapy is required.

      naringin on the growth of Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) and the life span of
      tumor-bearing Swiss albino mice were studied. Test components were given to mice 
      intraperitoneally (i.p.) at doses of 100mg kg(-1) for three consecutive days
      before the i.p. injection of EAT cells (1x10(6)). Irinotecan was administered
      i.p. at dose of 50mg kg(-1) on days 1, 13, and 19 after tumor cell inoculation.
      The results clearly demonstrate the synergistic action of irinotecan and EEP on
      survival time. These results suggest that clinical trials using a propolis
      preparation EEP combined with irinotecan may be beneficial in maximizing
      antitumor activity and minimizing post-chemotherapeutic reactions to the
      cytostatic drug.

AB  - In this study we compare the experimental and mathematical analyses of mechanical
      properties of PFM and analyze their correlation levels and inner links. Fifteen
      PFM specimens with different thickness ratio of metal to porcelain are made ,
      with the shape of 26mm x 4mm x 1.5mm, and are divided into 5 groups, the metal
      thickness increases with 0.05mm change each among every group from 0.25mm to
      0.45mm, the porcelain thickness decreases accordingly. The three-point-fracture
      test is used to measure their bending strength and elastic modulus, exhibit their
      changing laws, and disclose their inner relationships. When the whole thickness
      of the specimen is determined, the fracture load, bending strength and elastic
      modulus increase according to the increase of the metal thickness. The
      experimental mechanical properties of PFM are significantly influenced by the
      thickness ratio of metal to porcelain, and are the same as the theoretical ones
      calculated by the mixed law formula of compound material. There is significant
      correlation between the experimental analysis and mathematical analysis of
      mechanical properties of PFM. The regression coefficients can be obtained to
      describe this relationship. Further more, they can be used as the corrected
      parameters of the theoretical formula. The corrected mathematical formula is
      helpful to predicting and improving the mechanical properties of PFM.

AB  - The latest recommendations for building dynamic health behavior theories
      emphasize that cognitions, emotions, and behaviors--and the nature of their
      inter-relationships--can change over time. This paper describes the development
      and psychometric validation of four scales created to measure smoking-related
      causal attributions, perceived illness severity, event-related emotions, and
      intention to quit smoking among patients experiencing acute cardiac symptoms.
      After completing qualitative work with a sample of 50 cardiac patients, we
      administered the scales to 300 patients presenting to the emergency department
      for cardiac-related symptoms. Factor analyses, alpha coefficients, ANOVAs, and
      Pearson correlation coefficients were used to establish the scales' reliability
      and validity. Factor analyses revealed a stable factor structures for each of the
      four constructs. The scales were internally consistent, with the majority having 
      an alpha of >0.80 (range: 0.57-0.89). Mean differences in ratings of the
      perceived illness severity and event-related emotions were noted across the three
      time anchors. Significant increases in intention to quit at the time of
      enrollment, compared to retrospective ratings of intention to quit before the
      event, provide preliminary support for the sensitivity of this measure to the
      motivating impact of the event. Finally, smoking-related causal attributions,
      perceived illness severity, and event-related emotions correlated in the expected
      directions with intention to quit smoking, providing preliminary support for
      construct validity.

TI  - Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for intracranial germinomas in adult
      patients: a single-institution study.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - We report on our experience in the treatment of intracranial germinomas (18 pure 
      germinomas and two germinomas with syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells) according
      to a strategy of radiotherapy doses and fields reduction after a neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (Cisplatin-vinblastine and bleomycin combination). Radiation therapy
      was delivered after the completion of the third and last course of chemotherapy. 
      For the solitary germinoma the target volume was the gross tumour volume. In the 
      five multifocal germinoma patients the whole ventricle volume was irradiated. For
      the single disseminated germinoma patient we treated the whole central nervous
      system. The cumulative doses were 30 Gy for the pure germinomas. For the STGCs, a
      cumulative dose of 35 Gy was used. The median follow-up was 55 months (range
      12-120). 18 patients were alive without recurrence of disease. In the two
      patients with STGCs the death took place 16 and 35 months after diagnosis.

AB  - We have compared the purification procedures as well as the biochemical and
      kinetic properties of wild type (wt-SAL3), untagged recombinant (rec(-His)SAL3), 
      and tagged recombinant (rec(+His)SAL3) purified forms of Staphylococcus aureus
      lipase (SAL3). We used the pH-stat method (with emulsified tributyrin and olive
      oil as substrates) and the monomolecular film technique (with the three dicaprin 
      isomers spread in the form of monomolecular films at the air-water interface).
      The data obtained showed that the recombinant expression process as well as the
      presence of a his-tag at the N-terminus of recombinant SAL3 affects significantly
      many biochemical and catalytic properties. The effects of the heterologous
      expression process on the catalytic properties of the staphylococcal lipases are 
      three times more deleterious than the presence of an N-terminal tag extension.

TI  - A miRNA involved in phosphate-starvation response in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2038-43
AB  - Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been documented to regulate development in
      plants and animals , the function of miRNAs in physiology is unclear. miR399 has 
      multiple target sites in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of a gene encoding a
      putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We report
      here that miR399 was highly induced, whereas the target UBC mRNA was reduced by
      low-phosphate (Pi) stress. In transgenic plants with constitutive expression of
      miR399, UBC mRNA accumulation was suppressed even under high Pi. The expression
      of transgene UBC mRNA with 5' UTR miR399 target sites, but not the one without 5'
      UTR, was reduced under low-Pi condition. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis
      plants with constitutive expression of miR399 accumulated more Pi than the
      wild-type, and transgenic plants expressing the UBC mRNA without 5' UTR
      (miRNA-deregulated) showed less inhibition of primary root growth and less
      induction of a Pi transporter gene by low-Pi stress than those of wild-type
      plants. We conclude that miR399 downregulates UBC mRNA accumulation by targeting 
      the 5' UTR, and this regulation is important for plant responses to Pi
      starvation. The results suggest that miRNAs have functional roles for plants to
      cope with fluctuations in mineral-nutrient availability in the soil.

      understood at the molecular level, which has made the discovery and preclinical
      evaluation of SARMs difficult. OBJECTIVES: We review the current state of SARM
      discovery and preclinical evaluation, as well as our current understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms controlling AR selectivity. We then discuss how increasing
      our molecular knowledge of AR selectivity will help create better discovery and
      evaluation methods and lead to a wider array of safer SARMs. CONCLUSIONS: The
      SARM field has advanced rapidly, but without a solid foundation of molecular
      knowledge to inform discovery and preclinical evaluation methods. The field has
      also taken a narrow view of selectivity, disregarding many androgen-responsive
      tissues, which could lead to unforeseen and detrimental side effects with chronic
      administration of SARMs. An investment in basic research could accelerate the
      discovery of a new generation of more selective and safer SARMs that could be
      used to treat an expanded range of clinical conditions.

TI  - Detecting cholesteatoma with non-echo planar (HASTE) diffusion-weighted magnetic 
      resonance imaging.
PG  - 141-6

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance
      of half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo-spin-echo (HASTE)
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) in the detection of
      cholesteatoma. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective blinded comparative study. SETTING:
      London teaching hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects comprised 32 consecutive
      patients with suspected primary or residual cholesteatoma. HASTE DWMRI was
      performed on all patients an average of three months before mastoid surgery and
      evaluated for the presence of cholesteatoma. Radiological findings were
      correlated with intraoperative findings. RESULTS: HASTE DWMRI accurately
      predicted the presence or absence of cholesteatoma in 30 of 32 patients. Residual
      cholesteatoma was correctly diagnosed by DWMRI in 12 of 14 cases and correctly
      excluded in six, with two false-negative results caused by movement artifact and 
      keratin pearls less than 2 mm. All primary cholesteatomas were correctly
      identified. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]
      0.75-0.99) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.54-1.0), respectively, whereas positive and
      negative predictive values were 1.00 (95% CI 0.86-1.00) and 0.75 (95% CI
      0.35-0.97), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the increasing but small
      body of evidence that non-echo-planar imaging (i.e., HASTE) DWMRI performs well
      in the detection of cholesteatoma. We propose that HASTE DWMRI should be
      performed on all patients before their second-look surgery to provide valuable
      information to the operating surgeon.

LID - 10.1364/OE.23.028170 [doi]
AB  - The recent advance in the assembly of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) has enabled
      sophisticated engineering of unprecedented light-matter interaction at the
      optical domain. In this work, I expand the design flexibility of NP optical
      metamaterial to push the upper limit of accessible refractive index to the
      unnaturally high regime. The precise control over the geometrical parameters of
      NP superlattice monolayer conferred the dramatic increase in electric resonance
      and related effective permittivity far beyond the naturally accessible regime.
      Simultaneously, effective permeability change, another key factor to achieving
      high refractive index, was effectively suppressed by reducing the thickness of
      NPs. By establishing this design rule, I have achieved unnaturally high
      refractive index (15.7 at the electric resonance and 7.3 at the quasi-static
      limit) at broadband optical frequencies (100 THz ~300 THz). I also combined this 
      NP metamaterial with graphene to electrically control the high refractive index
      over the broad optical frequencies.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the FAS and FASL genes and risk of lung cancer in a Korean
      population.
PG  - 303-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FAS and FASL system play an important role in regulating
      extrinsic apoptotic pathway and inappropriate regulation of this signaling
      pathway contributes to lung tumorigenesis. Polymorphisms in the promoter region
      of the FAS (-1377G>A and -670A>G) and FASL (-844C>T) have been shown to alter the
      transcriptional activities of these genes. In order to evaluate the contribution 
      of these polymorphisms to the risk of lung cancer, we carried out a case-control 
      study in a Korean population. METHODS: The FAS and FASL genotypes were determined
      in 582 lung cancer patients and 582 healthy control subjects who were
      frequency-matched for age and gender. RESULTS: The FAS and FASL genotypes and the
      FAS haplotypes exhibited no apparent relationship with the risk of lung cancer.
      In addition, there was no significant interaction between the FAS and FASL
      polymorphisms in the development of lung cancer. CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest that the FAS-1377G>A and -670A>G and FASL-844C>T polymorphisms do not
      significantly affect the susceptibility to lung cancer in Koreans.

AB  - Reperfusion therapy of the infarct-related artery (IRA) with primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention is the cornerstone for the treatment of patients with
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, up to 30% of STEMI patients 
      present a multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Several methods are now available
      for the assessment of functional severity of a coronary stenosis both for IRA and
      non-culprit coronary lesions. The functional assessment of the IRA has mainly a
      prognostic implication in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events, recovery 
      of left ventricular function and evaluation myocardial viability. Conversely, the
      functional assessment of the non-culprit coronary lesions has a fundamental role 
      to guide staged revascularization. The aim of this review is to revise the most
      validated methods to perform the functional assessment of both culprit and
      non-culprit lesion in ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

      and ADHD symptoms of their children.
PG  - 124-30
LID - 10.4306/pi.2014.11.2.124 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit
      considerable impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. The
      present study aimed to examine the patterns of associations between ADHD
      symptoms, depression, and family functioning. METHODS: The sample consisted of
      1,022 adults randomly selected from a district in Seoul, South Korea. Several
      self-assessment scales were utilized to rate ADHD symptoms (both past and
      current), current symptoms of depression, and level of family functioning. ADHD
      symptoms in the children of these participants were also assessed. Pearson's
      correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed; structural
      equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to determine the best fitting model.
      RESULTS: Adult ADHD symptoms were positively associated with depressive symptoms.
      Depressive symptoms, in turn, mediated the relationship between adult ADHD
      symptoms and cohesion among family members. In addition, depressive symptoms
      mediated the relationship between adult ADHD symptoms and their children's ADHD
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: The relationship between adult ADHD symptoms and family
      dysfunction may be influenced by depressive symptoms. When treating ADHD in
      adults, clinicians should pay attention to the presence or absence of depression.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha protects against lethal West Nile virus infection by 
      promoting trafficking of mononuclear leukocytes into the central nervous system.
PG  - 8956-64
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01118-08 [doi]
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that has emerged globally as a 
      significant cause of viral encephalitis in humans, especially in
      immunocompromised individuals. Previous studies have shown essential protective
      roles for antiviral cytokines (e.g., alpha interferon [IFN-alpha] and IFN-gamma) 
      against WNV in mice. However, studies using cell culture offer conflicting
      answers regarding whether tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has an anti-WNV
      function. To test the biological significance of TNF-alpha against WNV in vivo,
      experiments were performed with TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1)-deficient and
      TNF-alpha-depleted C57BL/6 mice. TNF-R1(-/-) mice had enhanced mortality and
      decreased survival time after WNV infection compared to congenic wild-type mice. 
      Consistent with this, administration of a neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal 
      antibody also decreased survival after WNV infection. Relatively small
      differences in viral burdens in peripheral tissues of TNF-R1(-/-) mice were
      observed, and this occurrence correlated with a modest antiviral effect of
      TNF-alpha on primary macrophages but not dendritic cells. In contrast, the viral 
      titers detected in the central nervous systems of TNF-R1(-/-) mice were
      significantly increased compared to those of wild-type mice, although TNF-alpha
      did not have a direct antiviral effect in primary neuron cultures. Whereas no
      defect in priming of adaptive B- and T-cell responses in TNF-R1(-/-) mice was
      observed, there were significant reductions in accumulations of CD8+ T cells and 
      macrophages in the brain. Our data are most consistent with a model in which
      interaction of TNF-alpha with TNF-R1 protects against WNV infection by regulating
      migration of protective inflammatory cells into the brain during acute infection.

TI  - The association between parental attributions of misbehavior and parenting
      practices in caregivers raising children with prenatal alcohol exposure: A
      mixed-methods study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Limited research has focused on parenting practices used by 
      caregivers raising children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The
      current study hypothesized that parental attributions of children's misbehavior
      would relate to the parenting strategies caregivers utilize with children with
      FASD. This study also aimed to develop a coding scheme to allow quantification of
      these treatment-relevant constructs in future intervention trials. METHODS:
      Thirty-one caregivers of children with FASD (age 4-8) were interviewed with the
      Parenting Practices Interview (PPI), a study-developed qualitative interview.
      Quantitative measures of FASD knowledge, parenting sense of competence and
      stress, and child behavior problems were included. Mixed-method analyses assessed
      the relationship between parental attributions of misbehavior and parenting
      practices. RESULTS: Caregivers who attributed their child's misbehavior to
      underlying neurodevelopmental disabilities were more likely to use antecedent
      strategies and feel more confident in managing their child's behavior. Parents
      who attributed their child's misbehavior to willful disobedience were more likely
      to rely on consequence strategies and feel more ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Results
      are consistent with theoretical models for FASD parent training interventions.
      Assessment of theorized mechanisms of change in intervention trials is needed;
      the development of the PPI and quantitative coding system will facilitate this
      type of research.

TI  - Massive haemorrhage from hepatic laceration with diaphragmatic laceration: a
      potential limitation of the FAST examination: case report.
PG  - 633-4
AB  - This report describes the case of a multitrauma patient who had life-threatening 
      intraabdominal hemorrhage with a diaphragmatic laceration. This hemorrhage
      remained undetected by serial focus assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) 
      examination. The potential for intraabdominal blood to move through a
      diaphragmatic laceration to the pleural space may limit the development of
      hemoperitoneum, rendering the FAST examination misleading or producing a
      false-negative result. The use of the FAST examination is discussed along with
      its advantages and limitations.

TI  - [Specificity of communication in general practice].
PG  - 377-380
AB  - Beyond its scientific and ethical competencies, a good doctor is characterized by
      his communication skills. The ability to listen is fundamental. During an
      interview, the physician must keep in mind a bio-psycho-social approach while
      being able to hear the unspeakable and inaudible. Knowledge of patients and their
      relatives, which seems to be a specific knowledge for general practitioners,
      offers a lot of information. Among the main sensitive topics that the clinician
      must identify are: intrafamily violence, domestic violence, substance abuse and
      anxiety-depressive disorders. In order to improve, the practitioner can use tools
      such as the Calgary-Cambridge guide and techniques used in Motivational
      Maintenance.

TI  - Gene expression alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex and blood cells in a 
      mouse model of depression during menopause.
PG  - e00219
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2016.e00222 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is higher in women than
      in men, and this may be due to the decline in estrogen levels that occurs during 
      the menopausal transition. We studied the biological alterations in the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is a region that is highly implicated in the
      neurobiology of MDD, and the blood cells (BCs) of ovariectomized (OVX) mice
      subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS), which represents a mouse model of
      depression during menopause. MAIN METHODS: The mPFC and the BCs were obtained
      from the same individuals. Gene expression levels were analyzed by microarray.
      The data were used for the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the Gene Ontology
      analysis. KEY FINDINGS: The gene expression alterations (GEAs) induced by OVX
      were mainly associated with ribosomal and mitochondrial functions in both the
      mPFC and the BCs. Rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR) was identified
      as a possible upstream regulator of the OVX-induced GEAs in both tissues. The
      CMS-induced GEAs were associated with retinoic acid receptor signaling,
      inflammatory cytokines and post-synaptic density in the mPFC, but not in the BCs.
      SIGNIFICANCE: OVX and CMS independently affect biological pathways in the mPFC,
      which is involved in the development of the depression-like phenotype. Because a 
      subset of the OVX-induced GEAs in the mPFC also occurred in the BCs, the GEAs in 
      the BCs might be a useful probe to predict biological pathways in the
      corresponding brain tissue under specific conditions such as OVX in females.

PG  - 5322-5334

LID - 123708 [pii]
AB  - Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory demyelinating 
      disease of the central nervous system (CNS), induced by the adoptive transfer of 
      myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells into naive syngeneic mice. It is widely used as a
      rodent model of multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of EAE lesions is
      initiated when transferred CD4+ T cells access the CNS and are reactivated by
      local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) bearing endogenous myelin peptide/MHC class
      II complexes. The identity of the CNS-resident, lesion-initiating APCs is widely 
      debated. Here we demonstrate that classical dendritic cells (cDCs) normally
      reside in the meninges, brain, and spinal cord in the steady state. These cells
      are unique among candidate CNS APCs in their ability to stimulate naive, as well 
      as effector, myelin-specific T cells to proliferate and produce proinflammatory
      cytokines directly ex vivo. cDCs expanded in the meninges and CNS parenchyma in
      association with disease progression. Selective depletion of cDCs led to a
      decrease in the number of myelin-primed donor T cells in the CNS and reduced the 
      incidence of clinical EAE by half. Based on our findings, we propose that cDCs,
      and the factors that regulate them, be further investigated as potential
      therapeutic targets in MS.

TI  - Operational definition of intrinsically unstructured protein sequences based on
      susceptibility to the 20S proteasome.
PG  - 1357-66
AB  - Intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs), also known as natively unfolded
      proteins, lack well-defined secondary and tertiary structure under physiological 
      conditions. In recent years, growing experimental and theoretical evidence has
      accumulated, indicating that many entire proteins and protein sequences are
      unstructured under physiological conditions, and that they play significant roles
      in diverse cellular processes. Bioinformatic algorithms have been developed to
      identify such sequences in proteins for which structural data are lacking, but
      still generate substantial numbers of false positives and negatives. We describe 
      here a simple and reliable in vitro assay for identifying IUP sequences based on 
      their susceptibility to 20S proteasomal degradation. We show that 20S proteasomes
      digest IUP sequences, under conditions in which native, and even molten globule
      states, are resistant. Furthermore, we show that protein-protein interactions can
      protect IUPs against 20S proteasomal action. Taken together, our results thus
      suggest that the 20S proteasome degradation assay provides a powerful system for 
      operational definition of IUPs.

TI  - Morphometric classification and spatial organization of spiral ganglion neurons
      in the human cochlea: consequences for single fiber response to electrical
      stimulation.
PG  - 120-35
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.03.033 [doi]
AB  - The unique, unmyelinated perikarya of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) in the human
      cochlea are often arranged in functional units covered by common satellite glial 
      cells. This micro anatomical peculiarity presents a crucial barrier for an action
      potential (AP) travelling from the sensory receptors to the brain. Confocal
      microscopy was used to acquire systematically volumetric data on perikarya and
      corresponding nuclei in their full dimension along the cochlea of two
      individuals. Four populations of SGCs within the human inner ear of two different
      specimens were identified using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, contrary
      to the present distinction of two groups of SGCs. Furthermore, we found evidence 
      of a spatial arrangement of perikarya and their accordant nuclei along the
      cochlea spiral. In this arrangement, the most uniform sizes of cell bodies are
      located in the middle turn, which represents the majority of phonational
      frequencies. Since single-cell recordings from other mammalians may not be
      representative to humans and human SGCs are not accessible for physiological
      measurements, computer simulation has been used to quantify the effect of varying
      soma size on single neuron response to electrical micro stimulation. Results show
      that temporal parameters of the spiking pattern are affected by the size of the
      cell body. Cathodic stimulation was found to induce stronger variations of spikes
      while also leading to the lowest thresholds and longest latencies. Therefore,
      anodic stimulation leads to a more uniform excitation profile among SGCs with
      different cell body size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: groin pain affects all types of athletes, especially soccer players. 
      Many diseases with different etiologies may cause groin pain. PURPOSE: offer a
      mini review of groin pain in soccer accompanied by the presentation of a case
      report highlighting the possible association of more clinical frameworks into the
      onset of groin pain syndrome, in order to recommend that clinical evaluations
      take into account possible associations between bone, muscle and tendon such as
      inguinal canal disease. CONCLUSION: the multifactorial etiology of groin pain
      syndrome needs to be examined with a comprehensive approach, with standardized
      clinical evaluation based on an imaging protocol in order to evaluate all
      possible diseases. STUDY DESIGN: Mini review- Case report (Level V).

TI  - [Ligneous conjunctivitis: complication of inborn plasminogen deficiency (a case
      report)].
PG  - 38-49
AB  - Authors refer about detailed analysis of ten years follow up of a child patient
      with ligneous conjunctivitis. They document presence of all typical eye findings 
      (especially recurrent formation of granulomatous pseudotumors in affected mucous 
      membrane) related to this rare pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. The clinical
      picture of the disease includes plasminogen deficiency, a factor newly considered
      as primary cause of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed histologicaly by
      repeated probatory excisions. Pseudomembranous inflammation with mixed
      inflammatory infiltrate containing large amount of elements of chronical as well 
      as acute inflammatory reaction is typical. Granuloma with the accumulation of the
      PAS-positive amorphous matrix with high content of the fibrin and with the
      network of newly formed vessels is the component of the inflammatory picture. The
      treatment was based on successively discovered knowledge of the possible
      etiopathogenesis of the disease. Only the ninth, last surgical procedure induced 
      longer-term remission, which lasts sixteen months until now. The granuloma
      excision was combined with the mitomicin application on the wound surface and a
      conjunctivoplasty. During the postoperative period, the ointment with heparin,
      corticosteroid and antibiotic was applied. The purpose of the mitomicin use is to
      slow down the fibroproliferative reparative reaction. Covering of the wound
      surface decreases the number of microtraumas on the uneven postoperative scleral 
      surface. Heparin in the interstitial tissue of the wound surface blocks the
      conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.

TI  - Performance of dryland and wetland plant species on extensive green roofs.
PG  - 671-9
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcr007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Green roofs are constructed ecosystems where plants perform 
      valuable services, ameliorating the urban environment through roof temperature
      reductions and stormwater interception. Plant species differ in functional
      characteristics that alter ecosystem properties. Plant performance research on
      extensive green roofs has so far indicated that species adapted to dry conditions
      perform optimally. However, in moist, humid climates, species typical of wetter
      soils might have advantages over dryland species. In this study, survival, growth
      and the performance of thermal and stormwater capture functions of three pairs of
      dryland and wetland plant species were quantified using an extensive modular
      green roof system. METHODS: Seedlings of all six species were germinated in a
      greenhouse and planted into green roof modules with 6 cm of growing medium. There
      were 34 treatments consisting of each species in monoculture and all combinations
      of wet- and dryland species in a randomized block design. Performance measures
      were survival, vegetation cover and roof surface temperature recorded for each
      module over two growing seasons, water loss (an estimate of evapotranspiration)
      in 2007, and albedo and water capture in 2008. KEY RESULTS: Over two seasons,
      dryland plants performed better than wetland plants, and increasing the number of
      dryland species in mixtures tended to improve functioning, although there was no 
      clear effect of species or habitat group diversity. All species had survival
      rates >75 % after the first winter; however, dryland species had much greater
      cover, an important indicator of green roof performance. Sibbaldiopsis tridentata
      was the top performing species in monoculture, and was included in the best
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Although dryland species outperformed wetland species,
      planting extensive green roofs with both groups decreased performance only
      slightly, while increasing diversity and possibly habitat value. This study
      provides further evidence that plant composition and diversity can influence
      green roof functions.

TI  - Bioluminescence imaging of systemic tumor targeting using a prostate-specific
      lentiviral vector.
PG  - 125-32
AB  - Developments in vector design using tissue-specific and tumor-specific promoters 
      have led to significant improvements in tumor-targeting strategies. These
      developments combined with the ability to monitor gene expression by molecular
      imaging have facilitated the detection and prolonged monitoring of disease
      progression in small-animal models. Bioluminescence imaging offers a convenient
      and sensitive platform for monitoring gene expression patterns in preclinical
      models of gene therapy. Targeting a specific subset of cells/tissues via systemic
      delivery of vectors would be highly beneficial in gene therapy protocols. Using a
      two-step transcriptional amplification (TSTA)-based lentiviral vector (LV-TSTA), 
      we demonstrate specific targeting of prostate tumors in vivo after systemic
      administration of lentivirus. Four days after intravenous administration of
      LV-TSTA into adult severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (n=5) carrying
      subcutaneous prostate tumors, we found significant levels of transduction at the 
      tumor site when compared with other organs (p<0.05). Gene expression was
      sustained in the tumor for up to 3 weeks (7.3x10(4)+/-2x10(4) photons/
      sec/cm2/steradian (p/sec/cm2/sr) on day 4 and 7.0x10(4)+/-4x10(4) p/sec/cm2/sr on
      day 21). Low levels of transduction were also observed in the spleen and liver
      (5.0x10(2)+/-1.7x10(2) p/sec/cm2/sr). The results from this study support the use
      of TSTA-based lentiviral vectors for prostate tumor targeting after systemic
      delivery. Noninvasive imaging using such vectors should be useful for monitoring 
      long-term gene expression in gene therapy applications.

AB  - Genome-wide association and fine-mapping studies in 14 autoimmune diseases (AID) 
      have implicated more than 250 loci in one or more of these diseases. As more than
      90% of AID-associated SNPs are intergenic or intronic, pinpointing the causal
      genes is challenging. We performed a systematic analysis to link 460 SNPs that
      are associated with 14 AID to causal genes using transcriptomic data from 629
      blood samples. We were able to link 71 (39%) of the AID-SNPs to two or more
      nearby genes, providing evidence that for part of the AID loci multiple causal
      genes exist. While 54 of the AID loci are shared by one or more AID, 17% of them 
      do not share candidate causal genes. In addition to finding novel genes such as
      ULK3, we also implicate novel disease mechanisms and pathways like autophagy in
      celiac disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, 42 of the AID SNPs specifically
      affected the expression of 53 non-coding RNA genes. To further understand how the
      non-coding genome contributes to AID, the SNPs were linked to functional
      regulatory elements, which suggest a model where AID genes are regulated by
      network of chromatin looping/non-coding RNAs interactions. The looping model also
      explains how a causal candidate gene is not necessarily the gene closest to the
      AID SNP, which was the case in nearly 50% of cases.

PG  - 3487-94
LID - 10.1021/bm100994x [doi]
AB  - The hydroxy protons of kappa- and kappa/mu-hybrid carrageenan oligosaccharides
      have been studied by NMR spectroscopy in 85% H(2)O/15% acetone-d(6). Hydration
      and hydrogen bonding interactions in di- (kappa), tetra- (kappakappa), hexa
      (kappakappakappa), and octa- (kappakappakappakappa) kappa-oligosaccharides and
      hexa- (kappamukappa), octa- (kappamumukappa), and deca- (kappamumumukappa)
      kappa/mu-oligosaccharides have been investigated by measuring the chemical
      shifts, temperature coefficients, and chemical exchange of the hydroxy protons.
      These NMR parameters indicate that no strong and persistent intramolecular
      hydrogen bonds involving hydroxy protons stabilize the structure of
      kappa-carrageenan oligosaccharides in aqueous solution. In the
      kappa/mu-oligosaccharides, the presence of chemical exchange between OH3 of
      alpha-d-Gal-6-sulfate (D6S) and OH2 of beta-d-Gal-4-sulfate (G4S) across the
      beta-d-Gal-4-S-(1-->4)-alpha-d-Gal-6-S linkage reveals the existence of a weak
      hydrogen bond interaction between the two hydroxyl groups. The smaller
      temperature coefficients of OH2_D6S and OH3_D6S indicate reduced hydration,
      interpreted as spatial proximity to the 4-sulfate group and O5 ring oxygen of the
      neighboring G4S residues, respectively. These first experimental results on the
      conformation of kappa/mu-carrageenan oligosaccharides shine light on the
      potential role of "kinks" in the properties of the three-dimensional carrageenan 
      gel network.

AB  - We describe a dual-technique laser calorimeter for measuring the absorption of
      dielectric thin films in the UV region below 400 nm. The instrument measures the 
      temperature rise and absorption of a sample simultaneously by two independent
      techniques, namely, a resistance thermometer and a temperature transducer. The
      absorption constant beta and extinction coefficient kappa of Sb(2)O(3) and ZrO(2)
      films at 308 and 337 nm are measured by using the calorimeter. The principle,
      construction, and application of the calorimeter are described.

TI  - The new strategy for modulating dyslipidemia: consideration from updated
      understanding on high-density lipoprotein.
PG  - 467-70
LID - 10.1007/s11655-011-0632-3 [doi]
AB  - With further researches on blood lipids and atherosclerosis, especially after the
      conception of "residual cardiovascular risk", high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C) becomes a new therapeutic target against atherosclerosis.
      However, the failure of ILLUMINATE study that was targeted at raising HDL-C level
      disappointed cardiologists all over the world, which indicates the limitation of 
      HDL-C concentration in representing HDL function. The updated understanding of
      HDL from "quantity" to "quality" brings a new cut-in point for integrative
      Chinese and Western medicine in preventing and treating dyslipidemia and
      atherosclerosis. In addition to highlighting statins in directly intervening
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we should make full use of the superiority
      of Chinese medicine in overall regulation and individualized treatment to promote
      the self-healing capacity of the patients, which further regulates abnormity of
      both concentration and function of the whole blood lipid family to equilibrium.
      This new strategy for modulating dyslipidemia with mutual complement of
      advantages from Western and Chinese medicines will no doubt play an important
      role in future therapies.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Single-subject case. OBJECTIVES: To describe the atypical
      presentation of communication with a blind tetraplegic spinal cord injury patient
      on a respirator using an electrolarynx. SETTING: Critical care center in Osaka,
      Japan. METHODS: A 53-year-old blind man with tetraplegic spinal cord injury was
      admitted to our center. It was difficult for him to express his desires and to
      communicate with others about his severe condition and other details of his care.
      We began to use an electrolarynx to communicate with this patient because he
      could move his mouth. RESULTS: With use of the electrolarynx, the patient
      gradually became better able to speak fluently by electrolarynx on the first day 
      of use. The electrolarynx allowed us and his family to communicate with him. He
      was pleased with the improvement in communication. CONCLUSION: An electrolarynx
      is a useful method for communicating with blind tetraplegic spinal cord injury
      patients on mechanical ventilation.

TI  - HBV endemicity in Mexico is associated with HBV genotypes H and G.
PG  - 5446-53
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i33.5446 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes have distinct genetic and geographic diversity 
      and may be associated with specific clinical characteristics, progression,
      severity of disease and antiviral response. Herein, we provide an updated
      overview of the endemicity of HBV genotypes H and G in Mexico. HBV genotype H is 
      predominant among the Mexican population, but not in Central America. Its
      geographic distribution is related to a typical endemicity among the Mexicans
      which is characterized by a low hepatitis B surface antigen seroprevalence,
      apparently due to a rapid resolution of the infection, low viral loads and a high
      prevalence of occult B infection. During chronic infections, genotype H is
      detected in mixtures with other HBV genotypes and associated with other
      co-morbidities, such as obesity, alcoholism and co-infection with hepatitis C
      virus or human immunodeficiency virus. Hepatocellular carcinoma prevalence is
      low. Thus, antiviral therapy may differ significantly from the standard
      guidelines established worldwide. The high prevalence of HBV genotype G in the
      Americas, especially among the Mexican population, raises new questions regarding
      its geographic origin that will require further investigation.

TI  - Reducing the population burden of cardiovascular disease by reducing sodium
      intake: a report of the Council on Science and Public Health.
PG  - 1460-8
AB  - Across populations, the level of blood pressure, the incremental rise in blood
      pressure with age, and the prevalence of hypertension are directly related to
      sodium intake. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials document a 
      consistent effect of sodium consumption on blood pressure. The majority of sodium
      consumption in the United States is derived from amounts added during food
      processing and preparation. Leading scientific organizations and governmental
      agencies advise limiting sodium intake to 2400 mg or less daily (approximately
      6000 mg of salt). Substantial public health benefits accrue from small reductions
      in the population blood pressure distribution. A 1.3-g/d lower lifetime sodium
      intake translates into an approximately 5-mm Hg smaller rise in systolic blood
      pressure as individuals advance from 25 to 55 years of age, a reduction estimated
      to save 150,000 lives annually. With an appropriate food industry response,
      combined with consumer education and knowledgeable use of food labels, the
      average consumer should be able to choose a lower-sodium diet without
      inconvenience or loss of food enjoyment. In the continued absence of voluntary
      measures adopted by the food industry, new regulations will be required to
      achieve lower sodium concentrations in processed and prepared foods.

AB  - Naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells (nTregs) regulate
      lung allergic responses through production of IL-10 and TGF-beta. nTregs from
      CD8(-/-) mice failed to suppress lung allergic responses and were characterized
      by reduced levels of Foxp3, IL-10, and TGF-beta, and high levels of IL-6.
      Administration of anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6R to wild-type recipients prior to
      transfer of CD8(-/-) nTregs restored suppression. nTregs from IL-6(-/-) mice were
      suppressive, but lost this capability if incubated with IL-6 prior to transfer.
      The importance of CD8 in regulating the production of IL-6 in nTregs was
      demonstrated by the loss of suppression and increases in IL-6 following transfer 
      of nTregs from wild-type donors depleted of CD8(+) cells. Transfer of nTregs from
      CD8(-/-) donors reconstituted with CD8(+) T cells was suppressive, and
      accordingly, IL-6 levels were reduced. These data identify the critical role of
      CD8-T regulatory cell interactions in regulating the suppressive phenotype of
      nTregs through control of IL-6 production.

TI  - The impact of a quality improvement intervention to reduce nosocomial infections 
      in a PICU.
PG  - 525-32
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31828a87cc [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a quality improvement intervention could reduce
      nosocomial infection rates in a PICU and improve patient outcomes. DESIGN:
      Prospective interventional cohort study conducted during three periods:
      preintervention period, intervention period, and long-term follow-up. SETTING: A 
      14-bed medical and surgical PICU in a university hospital for children.
      INTERVENTIONS: The quality improvement intervention consisted of the creation of 
      an infection control team, a program targeting hand hygiene, and quality
      practices focused on preventing nosocomial infections. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
      RESULTS: We included 851 patients in the preintervention period, 822 in the
      intervention period, and 940 in the long-term follow-up period. Compared with the
      preintervention period, in the intervention period, the rates of central
      line-associated bloodstream infection decreased from 8.1 to 6/1,000 central
      venous catheter-days (p = 0.640), ventilator-associated pneumonia decreased from 
      28.3 to 10.6/1,000 days' ventilation (p = 0.005), and catheter-associated urinary
      tract infection decreased from 23.3 to 5.8/1,000 urinary catheter-days (p <
      0.001). Furthermore, hospital length of stay decreased from 18.56 to 14.57 days
      (p = 0.035) and mortality decreased from 5.1% to 3.3% (p = 0.056). Multivariable 
      logistic regression found that nosocomial infections was independently associated
      with increased mortality (odds ratio, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.02-5.55]; p = 0.046).
      Compared with the preintervention period, in the long-term follow-up period,
      central line-associated bloodstream infection decreased to 4.6/1,000 central
      venous catheter-days (p = 0.205); ventilator-associated pneumonia decreased to
      9.1/1,000 ventilation-days (p = 0.001), and catheter-associated urinary tract
      infection decreased to 5.2/1,000 urinary catheter-days (p < 0.001). Hospital
      length of stay (14.45 days; p = 0.048) and mortality (3.2%; p = 0.058) also
      decreased. CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted quality improvement intervention reduced
      nosocomial infection rates, hospital length of stay, and mortality in our PICU.
      The effects of the intervention were sustained over time.

AB  - Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is present in the endometrium of cows and
      other mammals. Recombinant HDGF (rHDGF) improves bovine blastocyst development in
      vitro. However, specific culture conditions and essential aspects of HDGF uterine
      physiology are yet unknown. In this work we quantified total HDGF protein in
      uterine fluid (UF) by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), and analyzed effects of
      rHDGF on specific embryonic stages with Day-6 bovine embryos cultured in vitro
      with and without BSA, and on pregnancy viability and calf phenotypes after embryo
      transfer to recipients. In addition, mRNA abundance of HDGF in endometrial cells 
      co-cultured with one male or one female embryo was quantified. In the presence of
      BSA, rHDGF had no effect on blastocyst development; however, in BSA-free culture 
      rHDGF mainly promoted development of early blastocysts in contrast with morulae. 
      As the presence of HDGF contained in commercial BSA replacements was suspected,
      western blot confirmed HDGF identification in BSA both with and without fatty
      acids. Total HDGF quantified by MRM tended to increase in UF without vs. UF with 
      embryos (P = 0.083). Pregnancy and birth rates, birth weight and calf
      measurements did not differ between embryos cultured with rHDGF and controls
      without rHDGF. However, HDGF abundance in cultured epithelial, endometrial cells 
      tended to increase (P < 0.08) in culture with one male embryo. rHDGF acts
      selectively on specific embryonic stages, but care should be taken with specific 
      macromolecular supplements in culture. The endometrial expression of HDGF can be 
      regulated by the embryonic sex. The use of rHDGF is compatible with pregnancy and
      birth of normal calves.

      cells exposed to X-rays.

AB  - Polymorphism of genes coding for proteins which participate in DNA repair may
      predispose to or protect against development of cancer. Here we studied how
      common polymorphisms of the genes XPD (Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln), APE1
      (Asp148Glu), XRCC1 (Arg399Gln), and NBS1 (Gln185Glu) influence DNA repair and
      other responses after X-irradiation of lymphocytes from colon carcinoma patients.
      Genotypes with polymorphic Asp148Glu APE1 and Asp312Asn XPD showed a
      significantly higher level of DNA incisions immediately after irradiation
      (p=0.049 and p=0.047 respectively) and Asp312Asn XPD showed a significantly
      increased capacity to repair of DNA strand breaks as measured 180min after
      irradiation by comet assays (p=0.004). In contrast, it was the wild type XRCC1
      genotype which was associated with a lower level of DNA breaks after irradiation 
      (p=0.014, at 180min after irradiation) and polymorphism of NBS1 did not correlate
      with any changes in DNA breaks or repair capacity. To confirm the influence of
      XPD polymorphism on repair, we established stably-transfected HCT116 (colon
      carcinoma) cells which over-expressed the wild-type or variant XPD protein. Cells
      over-expressing Asp312Asn XPD showed a higher level of DNA breaks shortly after
      irradiation and more efficient repair than cells over-expressing the wild-type
      gene XPD312Asp, and an earlier inhibition of cell cycle transit but faster
      recovery from this inhibition. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes therefore
      influence not only DNA repair capacity but also cell proliferation, and may serve
      as markers of individual repair capacity and susceptibility to environmental and

PG  - e91-3
LID - 10.1259/bjr/20677787 [doi]
AB  - The presence of a small amount of macroscopic fat is not unusual in the hilar
      region of normal lymph nodes. However, abundant replacement of the lymph node
      with fat is highly unusual and may appear as metastatic lymph node disease in the
      course of fat-predominant liposarcomas or in the case of coeliac disease
      complicated by cavitating lymph node syndrome. In this case report, a patient
      with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma who demonstrated an
      increasing abundance of macroscopic fat in the diseased lymph nodes is presented.
      To the best of our knowledge, the imaging findings of abundant fat in lymph nodes
      in the course of lymphoma have not been reported before. The presence of
      macroscopic fat may be seen in the presence of actively involved lymph nodes in
      the presence of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

TI  - Prioritizing chemicals and data requirements for screening-level exposure and
      risk assessment.
PG  - 1565-70
LID - 10.1289/ehp.1205355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientists and regulatory agencies strive to identify chemicals that 
      may cause harmful effects to humans and the environment; however, prioritization 
      is challenging because of the large number of chemicals requiring evaluation and 
      limited data and resources. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to prioritize chemicals for
      exposure and exposure potential and obtain a quantitative perspective on research
      needs to better address uncertainty in screening assessments. METHODS: We used a 
      multimedia mass balance model to prioritize > 12,000 organic chemicals using four
      far-field human exposure metrics. The propagation of variance (uncertainty) in
      key chemical information used as model input for calculating exposure metrics was
      quantified. RESULTS: Modeled human concentrations and intake rates span
      approximately 17 and 15 orders of magnitude, respectively. Estimates of exposure 
      potential using human concentrations and a unit emission rate span approximately 
      13 orders of magnitude, and intake fractions span 7 orders of magnitude. The
      actual chemical emission rate contributes the greatest variance (uncertainty) in 
      exposure estimates. The human biotransformation half-life is the second greatest 
      source of uncertainty in estimated concentrations. In general, biotransformation 
      and biodegradation half-lives are greater sources of uncertainty in modeled
      exposure and exposure potential than chemical partition coefficients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mechanistic exposure modeling is suitable for screening and
      prioritizing large numbers of chemicals. By including uncertainty analysis and
      uncertainty in chemical information in the exposure estimates, these methods can 
      help identify and address the important sources of uncertainty in human exposure 
      and risk assessment in a systematic manner.

TI  - Effects of Asian sand dust on mucin gene expression and activation of nasal polyp
      epithelial cells.
PG  - 303-6
LID - 10.2500/ajra.2011.25.3627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asian sand dust (ASD) contains a variety of chemical and
      microbiological materials such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-glucan that
      can cause inflammation. The increase in the atmospheric concentration of ASD has 
      been associated with asthma severity and adverse effects on respiratory function.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ASD on the inflammatory
      process and mucin gene expression in nasal epithelial cells. METHODS: Primary
      nasal polyp epithelial cells were exposed to ASD for 72 hours, and then the
      supernatants were collected. To determine the activation of the epithelial cells,
      IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were measured.
      In addition, the potential cytotoxic effects of ASD on the epithelial cells were 
      evaluated. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for MUC4,
      MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC8 mRNA expression, in the nasal epithelial cells, was
      performed. RESULTS: ASD stimulated the production of chemical mediators in a
      time-dependent manner. The cytokine production was highest at 100 micrograms/mL
      of ASD. MUC4 and MUC5B mRNA expression was significantly increased at 10 and 50
      micrograms/mL of ASD. CONCLUSION: Atomospheric exposure to various chemical
      species and microbiological materials carrying ASD may affect upper airway
      inflammation through the production of inflammatory cytokines and mucin.

TI  - Linking water uptake with rooting patterns in grassland species.
PG  - 261-72
AB  - Water availability strongly governs grassland primary productivity, yet this
      resource varies dramatically in time (seasonally) and space (with soil depth and 
      topography). It has long been assumed that co-occurring species differ in their
      partitioning of water use by depth, but direct evidence is lacking. We report
      data from two growing seasons (2004-2005) in which we measured the isotopic
      signature of plant xylem water from seven species (including C(3) forbs and
      shrubs and C(4) grasses) growing along a topographic gradient at the Konza
      Prairie Biological Station. Plant xylem stable oxygen isotope ratio (delta(18)O) 
      values were compared to soil water delta(18)O profiles, recent rainfall events,
      and groundwater. Species varied in both their temporal patterns of water use and 
      their responses to seasonal droughts in both years. During wet periods, species
      differences in water use were minimal, with common dependency on recent rainfall 
      events stored in the upper soil layers. However, during dry periods, most C(3)
      species used proportionally more water from deeper portions of the soil profile
      relative to the C(4) grasses. Plants in uplands used more shallow soil water
      compared to those in lowlands, with the greatest differences across the
      topographic gradient occurring during dry periods. While the documented vertical 
      root distribution varies by species and growth form in this grassland, each of
      the species we measured appeared to compete for the same surface layer soil
      moisture when water was not limiting. Thus, our results suggest that variation in
      precipitation history and landscape positions are greater determinants of
      water-use patterns than would be expected based on absolute rooting depth.

TI  - Sealing of esophageal perforation or ruptures with expandable metallic stents: a 
      prospective controlled study on treatment efficacy and limitations.
PG  - 262-6
AB  - Esophageal perforations are surgical emergencies with high mortality rates. A
      variety of treatment strategies have been advocated. No single strategy has
      however, been fully applicable to deal with most situations. The aim of this
      study was to investigate if treatment with covered expandable metallic stents
      could offer a feasible option for the management of a leaking esophagus
      regardless of cause. Twenty-two consecutive patients with perforation or leakage 
      from the intrathoracic esophagus were endoscopically treated with placement of a 
      covered expandable metallic stent. Nine patients had esophageal cancer and 13 had
      benign underlying disease of whom two had a leakage from a surgical anastomosis. 
      The leakage could be sealed in all but one patient. This patient died after an
      open esophageal diversion procedure. Twelve patients had an uneventful recovery, 
      whereas three patients needed percutaneous drainage of abscesses and one drainage
      of the pleural cavity through a small thoracotomy. One patient required a
      conventional thoracotomy to drain the mediastinum. In total five (23%) patients
      died from the perforation within 30 days. Two of the deaths were unrelated and
      three (14%) related to the perforation. In patients with benign disease stents
      were removed or replaced after 3 weeks. In total 17 stents were successfully

TI  - Structure-activity relationships of epolactaene derivatives: structural
      requirements for inhibition of Hsp60 chaperone activity.
PG  - 4425-9
AB  - Epolactaene is a microbial metabolite isolated from the fungal strain Penicillium
      sp. It arrests the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and induces the outgrowth of
      neurites in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In this communication, we report
      the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of new epolactaene derivatives,
      including those lacking the epoxylactam moiety and having various side chains.
      These derivatives were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of human
      cancer cell lines. They were also analyzed for their ability to affect human heat
      shock protein 60 (Hsp60), which we have already identified as a protein that
      binds to epolactaene. We also identified the important structural framework of
      epolactaene/ETB (epolactaene tertiary butyl ester) for not only binding to Hsp60 
      but also inhibiting Hsp60 chaperone activity.

AB  - The reaction of alpha-azidochalcones with carboxylic acids has been investigated 
      resulting in the formation of alpha-amido-1,3-diketones under microwave
      irradiation via in situ formation of 2H-azirine intermediates. An interesting
      reaction is described wherein, with trifluoroacetic acid at lower temperature, it
      affords highly substituted 2-(trifluoromethyl)oxazoles. These flexible
      transformations proceed under solvent free conditions in good to excellent yields
      without any catalyst.

TI  - Profile of vitiligo in kumaun region of uttarakhand, India.
PG  - 209
LID - 10.4103/0019-5154.127706 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is a common, acquired, pigmentary disorder characterized by 
      loss of melanocytes resulting in white spots. This disease carries a lot of
      social stigma in India. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinico-epidemiological profile
      of vitiligo patients in Kumaun region of Uttarakhand state in India. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: The clinical presentation of vitiligo was examined and analyzed in
      762 vitiligo patients attending the Dermatology outdoor of Government Medical
      College, Haldwani, which is a referral centre for Kumaun region of Uttarakhand
      state in India. RESULTS: Male and female patients were found to be affected
      almost equally. It was observed that onset of vitiligo was most common in 0-10
      years age group, as evidenced by 336 cases out of 762 cases. Acrofacial type of
      vitiligo (339 cases out of 762) was most commonly observed, followed by vitiligo 
      vulgaris, focal, segmental, mucosal, mixed, and universal vitiligo. The most
      common site of onset was the lower limbs followed by head and neck, upper limbs, 
      trunk, genitalia, and mucasae. Leucotrichia was observed in 33.5%, Koebner's
      phenomenon in 26.3%, and a positive family history in 19% of the vitiligo
      patients. The other common conditions associated were thyroid disorders (8.9%),
      diabetes (5.3%), and atopic dermatitis (4.9%). CONCLUSION: The study indicates
      that acrofacial vitiligo is the most common clinical type observed in Kumaun
      region of Uttarakhand in India. Onset of vitiligo is most common in first decade 
      of life.

TI  - In-vessel composting of different organic waste.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - Experimental data on bio degradation of wastes with different C/N ratios have
      been presented for vessel composting conditions. Detailed analysis on the routes 
      of stabilization of organic wastes was done. Greater efficiency during aeration
      have been pointed out and discussed. Necessity of detailed evaluation of
      temperature, pH, total solids, E.C, volatile solids, C.O.D, nutrient levels of
      carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, is suggested to achieve quicker
      bioconversion of organic wastes into humus. Four separate amendment conditions
      were applied to stimulate varying degrees of bioconversion rate. Optimum
      environmental conditions were maintained inside vessel through proper aeration,
      moisture adjustment and sufficient mixing.

TI  - Effect of Gallotannins Derived from Sedum takesimense on Tomato Bacterial Wilt.
PG  - 1593-1598
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-04-13-0350-RE [doi]
AB  - In the process of searching antibacterial agents from plants, we discovered that 
      the methanol extract of Sedum takesimense showed potent antibacterial activity
      against Ralstonia solanacearum in vitro and in vivo. Eight antibacterial
      gallotannins were isolated from the aerial parts of S. takesimense and identified
      as gallic acid, methyl gallate, 4,6-di-O-galloylarbutin, 2,6-di-O-galloylarbutin,
      2,4,6-tri-O-galloyl-glucose, 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-glucose,
      1,2,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-glucose, and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-glucose
      based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy. These gallotannins displayed broad-spectrum activity
      against various plant-pathogenic bacteria, and the strongest in vitro
      antibacterial activities of these gallotannins were against R. solanacearum
      minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.02 to 0.10 g/liter). Among these
      gallotannins, methyl gallate and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-glucose showed the 
      strongest activities. In addition, synergistic or partial synergistic effects
      were observed in most combinations between major antibacterial compounds. The
      wettable powder formulation of the S. takesimense crude extract effectively
      reduced the development of tomato bacterial wilt caused by R. solanacearum under 
      greenhouse conditions for 14 days after infection. This is the first report on
      the isolation of antibacterial compounds from S. takesimense. These results
      suggest that the extract from S. takesimense or the isolated gallotannins could
      be used as natural bactericides for the control of tomato bacterial wilt.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema--a dangerous new
      epidemic.
PG  - 260-4
LID - 10.2340/00015555-1760 [doi]
AB  - Angioedema is a sudden localised and often asymmetric swelling of the skin or
      mucous membranes caused by transient increased endothelial permeability causing
      plasma extravasation. In the last decades the incidence of severe angioedema
      involving the upper airways and even fatal outcome due to asphyxia has increased.
      This is mainly due to pharmaceuticals such as angiotensin converting
      enzyme-inhibitors, which are extensively used worldwide. Some aspects of the
      pathophysiology have been elucidated and the vasoactive molecule bradykinin is
      shown to be one of the main causative agents. The diagnosis is often delayed and 
      traditional treatment usually ineffective. Complement C1 inhibitor concentrate
      and bradykinin receptor antagonists, normally used to treat patients with
      hereditary angioedema, have shown good results when used in patients with
      bradykinin-mediated angioedema. This review discusses the disease, prognosis and 
      treatment options.

      2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-N'-[(un)substituted phenylmethylidene] acetohydrazides and
      2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-N'-[(un)substituted benzoyl/2-thienylcarbonyl]acetohydrazides.
PG  - 1263-1274
AB  - The undertaken research was initiated by transforming 2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)acetic
      acid (1) in catalytic amount of sulfuric acid and ethanol to ethyl
      2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)acetate (2), which was then reacted with hydrazine monohydrate
      in methanol to form 2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)acetohydrazide (3). Further, The reaction
      scheme was designed into two pathways where, first pathway involved The reaction 
      of 3 with substituted aromatic aldehydes (4a-o) in methanol with few drops of
      glacial acetic acid to generate
      2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-N'-[(un)substitutedphenylmethylidene]acetohydrazides (5a-o) and
      in second pathway 3 was reacted with acyl halides (6a-e) in basic aqueous medium 
      (pH 9-10) to afford
      2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-N'-[(un)substitutedbenzoyl/2-thienylcarbonyl]acetohydrazides
      (7a-e). All The synthesized derivatives were characterized by IR, EI-MS and
      1H-NMR spectral techniques and evaluated for their anti-bacterial potentials
      against Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains and it was found that
      compounds 7a-d exhibited antibacterial activities very close to standard
      Ciprofloxacin. The synthesized derivatives demonstrated moderate to weak
      anti-enzymatic potential against alpha-Glucosidase and Butyrylcholinesterase
      (BChE) where, compounds 7c and 5c exhibited comparatively better inhibition
      against these enzymes respectively. Compounds 7a, 7d and 7e showed excellent
      anti-enzymatic potentials against Lipoxygenase (LOX) and their IC50 values were
      much lower than the reference standard Baicalein. Enzyme inhibitory activities
      were also supported by computational docking results. Compounds 5c, 7a, 7b and 7c
      also showed low values of % hemolytic activity as well, showing that these
      molecules were not toxic, indicating that these molecules can be utilized as
      potential therapeutic agents against inflammatory ailments.

TI  - Exogenous synovial stem cells adhere to defect of meniscus and differentiate into
      cartilage cells.
PG  - 101-11
AB  - The meniscus is semilunar fibrocartilage, and its injury causes dysfunction of
      the knee. We previously reported a high chondrogenic potential of synovial
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Here, we examined whether intra-articular injected
      synovial MSCs adhered to the defect of the meniscus, survived there, and
      differentiated into cartilage cells. MSCs were isolated from the synovium of GFP 
      rats. Cylindrical defects were created in the menisci in wild rats, and
      GFP-positive synovial MSCs were injected into the knee. In the control group, 100
      microl of PBS was injected into the contralateral knee. The menisci were analyzed
      after day 1, weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. One day after injecting of 10(7) GFP-positive
      synovial MSCs, the meniscal defect was filled with the cells. The GFP-positive
      synovial MSCs expressed type II collagen, exhibited representative
      characteristics of chondrocytes by electron microscopy at 8 weeks, and could
      still be observed at 12 weeks. The histological score improved within 12 weeks
      but there were no statistical difference between the two groups at each period in
      this model. GFP mRNA expressions were not observed in distant organs at day 1.
      After intra-articular injection, synovial MSCs attached to the meniscal defect
      and differentiated into cartilage cells.

TI  - Operational impact of DDT reintroduction for malaria control on Anopheles
      arabiensis in Mozambique.
PG  - 885-90
AB  - ABSTRACT With the increase in indoor residual spraying in many internationally
      and nationally funded malaria control programs, and affirmation by World Health
      Organization (WHO) that DDT is appropriate for use in the absence of longer
      lasting insecticide formulations in some malaria endemic settings, DDT has been
      reintroduced as a major malaria control intervention in Africa. Indoor residual
      spraying with DDT was reintroduced into Mozambique for malaria control in 2005,
      and it is increasingly becoming the main insecticide used for malaria vector
      control in Mozambique. The selection of DDT in Mozambique is evidence-based,
      taking account of the susceptibility of Anopheles arabiensis (Patton) and
      Anopheles gambiae (Giles) s.s. to all the available insecticide choices, as well 
      as relative costs of the insecticide and the logistical costs of spraying. Before
      this time in Mozambique, DDT was replaced by h-cyhalothrin in 1993. Resistance
      occurred quickly to this insecticide, and in 2000 the pyrethroid was phased out
      and the carbamate bendiocarb was introduced. Low-level resistance was detected by
      biochemical assay to bendiocarb in 1999 in both Anopheles funestus (Giles) and
      An. arabiensis, although this was not evident in WHO bioassays of the same
      population. In the 2000-2006 surveys the levels of bendiocarb resistance had been
      selected to a higher level in An. arabiensis, with resistance detectable by both 
      biochemical and WHO bioassay. The insecticide resistance monitoring program
      includes assessment of field populations by standard WHO insecticide
      susceptibility assays and biochemical assays. Monitoring was established in 1999,
      and it was maintained as part of an operational monitoring and evaluation program
      thereafter.

TI  - FASTSNP: an always up-to-date and extendable service for SNP function analysis
      and prioritization.
PG  - W635-41
AB  - Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) prioritization based on the phenotypic risk 
      is essential for association studies. Assessment of the risk requires access to a
      variety of heterogeneous biological databases and analytical tools. FASTSNP
      (function analysis and selection tool for single nucleotide polymorphisms) is a
      web server that allows users to efficiently identify and prioritize high-risk
      SNPs according to their phenotypic risks and putative functional effects. A
      unique feature of FASTSNP is that the functional effect information used for SNP 
      prioritization is always up-to-date, because FASTSNP extracts the information
      from 11 external web servers at query time using a team of web wrapper agents.
      Moreover, FASTSNP is extendable by simply deploying more Web wrapper agents. To
      validate the results of our prioritization, we analyzed 1569 SNPs from the
      SNP500Cancer database. The results show that SNPs with a high predicted risk
      exhibit low allele frequencies for the minor alleles, consistent with a
      well-known finding that a strong selective pressure exists for functional
      polymorphisms. We have been using FASTSNP for 2 years and FASTSNP enables us to
      discover a novel promoter polymorphism. FASTSNP is available at
      http://fastsnp.ibms.sinica.edu.tw.

TI  - Forecasting Financial Extremes: A Network Degree Measure of Super-Exponential
      Growth.
PG  - e0128908
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0128908 [doi]
AB  - Investors in stock market are usually greedy during bull markets and scared
      during bear markets. The greed or fear spreads across investors quickly. This is 
      known as the herding effect, and often leads to a fast movement of stock prices. 
      During such market regimes, stock prices change at a super-exponential rate and
      are normally followed by a trend reversal that corrects the previous
      overreaction. In this paper, we construct an indicator to measure the magnitude
      of the super-exponential growth of stock prices, by measuring the degree of the
      price network, generated from the price time series. Twelve major international
      stock indices have been investigated. Error diagram tests show that this new
      indicator has strong predictive power for financial extremes, both peaks and
      troughs. By varying the parameters used to construct the error diagram, we show
      the predictive power is very robust. The new indicator has a better performance
      than the LPPL pattern recognition indicator.

TI  - Clinicians' Attitudes Towards an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at a
      Children's Hospital.
PG  - 190-7
LID - 10.1093/jpids/pis045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In pediatrics, limited data are available on how to develop and
      implement an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP). In addition, no data exist 
      on clinicians' impression of such programs. The objectives of this study were to 
      describe the development and implementation of an ASP in a children's hospital
      and to describe the thoughts and attitudes of the clinicians interacting with the
      ASP. METHODS: A qualitative description of the development and implementation of 
      an ASP is provided. In addition, 2 years after the implementation of a
      prospective-audit-with-feedback ASP, an electronic survey was administered to
      clinicians to assess their attitudes toward the ASP. RESULTS: A 5-step process
      for developing this ASP included the following: team development; selecting the
      stewardship strategy(ies) and antimicrobials to monitor; establishing a method to
      identify patients; program evaluation; and implementation. Of 365 participants
      surveyed, 205 (56%) responded, and 80% (160 of 199) had never worked with an ASP 
      before its implementation. Clinicians agreed that the ASP decreased inappropriate
      use of antibiotics (84%, 162 of 194), improved the quality of patient care (82%, 
      159 of 194), and provided knowledge and education about appropriate antibiotic
      use (91%, 177 of 194). Negative feelings regarding the ASP included the
      following: 11% (22 of 194) felt a loss of autonomy; 6% (12 of 194) felt that it
      interfered with clinical decision-making; and 5% (9 of 194) felt threatened.
      Clinicians thought that to further decrease inappropriate antibiotic use,
      guidelines of empiric antibiotic choices (80%, 152 of 189) should be developed,
      and better training in medical school and residency should be provided (80%, 152 
      of 189). Finally, our clinicians felt that the problem of antibiotic resistance
      and inappropriate antibiotic use was worse nationally than at our institution.
      CONCLUSIONS: A prospective-audit-with-feedback ASP was successfully developed and
      implemented at a children's hospital. The ASP was perceived by clinicians to
      reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and to improve the quality of care of
      hospitalized children, with minimal loss of physician autonomy or interference in
      clinical decision-making.

TI  - Stand-alone anterior lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative disc disease of the
      lumbar spine: results with a 2-year follow-up.
PG  - E894-901
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000000393 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes of a
      consecutive series of patients diagnosed with degenerative disc disease (DDD)
      between L4 and S1, treated with stand-alone anterior lumbar interbody fusion
      (ALIF, either 1 or 2 levels) and use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic
      protein 2 for bony fusion with instrumented fixation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
      Degeneration of the lumbar spine is described as lumbar spondylosis, or DDD. To
      treat DDD, surgical interventions include: ALIF, circumferential fusion (360
      degrees fusion), posterior spinal fusion, and total disc replacement. Currently, 
      there has been paucity in the literature on the evaluation of ALIFs. METHODS:
      Researchers reviewed a consecutive series of patients with DDD who had undergone 
      a 1-level or 2-level ALIF between 2005 and 2010, with the use of recombinant
      human bone morphogenetic protein 2. Patients' clinical and functional outcomes
      were documented. Radiographs were analyzed for disc height, mean optical density,
      and integrated optical density. Operative time, length of hospital stay, and
      estimated blood loss were also reported. RESULTS: Patients' 2-year Oswestry
      Disability Index and visual analogue scale presurgery scores significantly
      improved (P </= 0.0001). Patients' 2-year postoperative disc height was
      significantly greater than the preoperative disc height at the fused level (P </=
      0.0001); there was no significant difference at the level adjacent to fusion.
      Majority of patients (107 of 115, 93.0%) satisfied fusion criteria based on mean 
      optical density. Intraoperative time, estimated blood loss, and hospital stay was
      significantly fewer with 1-level and 2-level ALIFs than 360 degrees fusions and
      total disc replacement. CONCLUSION: Stand-alone ALIF used to treat DDD can
      produce comparative clinical and functional outcomes. ALIFs showed significant
      decreases in blood loss, operative time, and hospital stay. Furthermore, at 2
      years' time, mean optical density suggests high rate of bony fusion, and no
      significant loss of disc height was noted at the adjacent level. LEVEL OF
      EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - Long-term growth of soybean at elevated [CO2] does not cause acclimation of
      stomatal conductance under fully open-air conditions.
PG  - 1794-800
AB  - Accurately predicting plant function and global biogeochemical cycles later in
      this century will be complicated if stomatal conductance (g(s)) acclimates to
      growth at elevated [CO(2)], in the sense of a long-term alteration of the
      response of g(s) to [CO(2)], humidity (h) and/or photosynthetic rate (A). If so, 
      photosynthetic and stomatal models will require parameterization at each growth
      [CO(2)] of interest. Photosynthetic acclimation to long-term growth at elevated
      [CO(2)] occurs frequently. Acclimation of g(s) has rarely been examined, even
      though stomatal density commonly changes with growth [CO(2)]. Soybean was grown
      under field conditions at ambient [CO(2)] (378 micromol mol(-1)) and elevated
      [CO(2)] (552 micromol mol(-1)) using free-air [CO(2)] enrichment (FACE). This
      study tested for stomatal acclimation by parameterizing and validating the widely
      used Ball et al. model (1987, Progress in Photosynthesis Research, vol IV,
      221-224) with measurements of leaf gas exchange. The dependence of g(s) on A, h
      and [CO(2)] at the leaf surface was unaltered by long-term growth at elevated
      [CO(2)]. This suggests that the commonly observed decrease in g(s) under elevated
      [CO(2)] is due entirely to the direct instantaneous effect of [CO(2)] on g(s) and
      that there is no longer-term acclimation of g(s) independent of photosynthetic
      acclimation. The model accurately predicted g(s) for soybean growing under
      ambient and elevated [CO(2)] in the field. Model parameters under ambient and
      elevated [CO(2)] were indistinguishable, demonstrating that stomatal function
      under ambient and elevated [CO(2)] could be modelled without the need for
      parameterization at each growth [CO(2)].

TI  - Domains of unprofessional behavior during medical school associated with future
      disciplinary action by a state medical board.
PG  - S17-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we showed that unprofessional behavior in
      medical school was associated with subsequent disciplinary action. This study
      expands on that work by identifying the domains of unprofessional behavior that
      are most problematic. METHOD: In this retrospective case-control study, negative 
      comments were extracted from student files for 68 case (disciplined) and 196
      matched control (nondisciplined) physicians. Comments were analyzed qualitatively
      and subsequently quantified. The relationship between domains of behavior and
      disciplinary action was established through chi-square tests and multivariate
      analysis of variance. RESULTS: Three domains of unprofessional behavior emerged
      that were related significantly to later disciplinary outcome: (1) poor
      reliability and responsibility, (2) lack of self-improvement and adaptability,
      and (3) poor initiative and motivation. CONCLUSIONS: Three critical domains of
      professionalism associated with future disciplinary action have been defined.
      These findings could lead to focused remediation strategies and policy decisions.

TI  - Factors contributing to surgical site infection in patients with oral cancer
      undergoing microvascular free flap reconstruction.
PG  - 2101-2108
LID - 10.1007/s00405-018-5035-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are associated with considerable medical
      expenditure. While head and neck free flap reconstruction has gradually become
      routine management following an ablative oncologic resection, reports on factors 
      contributing to the SSIs are lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 173
      new patients with oral cancer without any antecedent treatment at a tertiary
      medical center from 2010 to 2015. We determined incidence rates of SSIs within 30
      days postoperatively and identified independent risk factors using multivariate
      logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 173 patients, 67 (38.7%) had SSIs.
      Multivariate analysis demonstrated operative time [odds ratio (OR) = 1.199, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) = 1.036-1.389], mandibulectomy (OR = 2.759; 95% CI =
      1.245-6.111), and oro-neck communication (OR = 5.358; 95% CI = 2.150-13.355) as
      independent predictors for SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with oral cancer
      undergoing free tissue reconstruction, mandibulectomy, oro-neck communication,
      and prolonged operative time were associated with increased incidence of SSIs.

TI  - Effect of inhaled combination therapy on asthma management.
PG  - 57-63
AB  - The growing use of guidelines to manage asthmatic patients prompted us to
      evaluate their impact on clinical practice. This study was performed in two
      similar groups of asthmatic patients. A retrospective and prospective review of
      medical records in an asthmatic population was performed. The patients were
      followed up for a mean period of 2 years before (group 1 [G1]) and after the
      publication of the Guideline for Asthma Treatment (group 2 [G2]). After
      evaluation of objective/clinical measurements we noticed a significant difference
      between both groups. There were 23 and 40 patients who did not complain of any
      respiratory symptoms in G1 and G2, respectively. The total number of visits to
      the emergency department decreased by more than 75%, from 26 (G1) to six (G2).
      The forced expiratory volume in 1 sec improved by a mean of 4% in G1 and 9% in
      G2. After application of the guidelines there was a redistribution of the degree 
      of disease severity. In G2, there was a 12% increase in the use of long-acting
      beta2-stimulating sprays; 40% of the patients were using a combination of a
      long-acting beta2-stimulating drug and an inhaled steroid. In our experience, the
      use of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines leads to better
      management of asthma patients with different degrees of severity. These findings 
      suggest the need to perform a similar analysis in a broader setting such as a
      national multicenter survey in order to collect information on the challenges of 
      putting these theoretical difficulties into practice and to compare their
      implementation in distinct centers.

TI  - Ventricular fibrillation in a 5-year-old child on therapeutic dose of quinine
      dihydrochloride infusion for acute malaria.
PG  - 1063-5
AB  - Malaria is no doubt a disease of public health significance in the tropics.
      Plasmodium falciparum resistant to majority of the first-line antimalarial drugs 
      now causes most of the infections treated in sub-Saharan Africa. Although there
      is increasing use of artemisinin-based combination therapy in many African
      nations, quinine still remains a commonly used drug for severe and
      chloroquine-resistant malaria. Cardiotoxicity associated with quinine has been
      largely reported. However, this was often more common with toxic doses. This case
      report is on a 5-year-old African Nigerian who was on treatment for uncomplicated
      malaria with quinine dihydrochloride infusion. All the laboratory investigations 
      done were within normal limits except for positive blood films for malarial
      parasites. However, pre-treatment electrocardiographic evaluation of the patient 
      was not carried out. She developed ventricular fibrillation and died less than
      one and a half hour into the quinine infusion.

TI  - Evaluation of hyponatremia: a little physiology goes a long way.
PG  - 639-50
AB  - Hyponatremia is common in hospitalized patients. By taking a careful and logical 
      approach, one can promptly recognize the causative factor or factors in nearly
      all cases. Most cases of hyponatremia are due to impaired renal water excretion, 
      and recognizing the cause and pathophysiologic process makes it possible to
      provide focused individualized care and avoid mistreatment.

TI  - Does insulin-like growth factor 1 contribute in red blood cell transfusions to
      the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity during retinal neovascularization?
PG  - 92-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are associated with the development
      of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). During the period of retinal
      neovascularization a rise of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) may trigger
      rapid growth of new blood vessels. OBJECTIVES: To study endocrine factors in RBC 
      transfusions that might be of importance for ROP. METHODS: IGF-1, IGF-2 and their
      binding proteins 1-3 (IGFBP-1-3) were determined by radioimmunoassays in 7
      very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants with ROP >or= stage 2 receiving a RBC
      transfusion, in 10 controls (VLBW infants with ROP <or= stage 1, no transfusion),
      in supernatants of 7 RBCs and of 5 washed RBCs (WRBC). RESULTS: IGF-1 (mean +/-
      SD) in infants with ROP was 20.0 +/- 4.2 microg/l, in controls 35.9 +/- 15.2
      microg/l (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.030). IGF-1 in RBC was 12.88 +/- 5.03
      microg/l and in WRBC 0.45 +/- 0.74 microg/l (average of the three-course washing 
      procedure). IGF-2 in infants with ROP was 485.67 +/- 158.73 microg/l, in controls
      389.9 +/- 102.8 microg/l (not significant), in RBC 109.50 +/- 117.89 microg/l, in
      WRBC 61.07 +/- 30.0 microg/l. Except for IGFBP-3 other IGFBPs were barely or not 
      detectable in RBC or WRBC. CONCLUSIONS: Considering lower IGF-1 concentrations in
      preterm infants than in adults (factor 20), the IGF-1 in RBC transfusions is
      equivalent to a single dose of 1 microg/kg IGF-1 (5-10% of the adult dose with
      proved metabolic responses). Endocrinological relationships between the donor's
      load and the acceptor's individual features are a new aspect of potential side
      effects of RBC transfusions. Further research is necessary to clarify the share
      of the described IGF administration on the development of ROP.

TI  - Haemorrhage Rates After Two Commonly Used Tonsillectomy Methods: a Multicenter
      Study.
PG  - 119-121
LID - 10.5455/medarh.2017.71.119-121 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tonsillectomy is a frequently used, low-risk surgical procedure.
      The post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage occurs rarely, but is a life-threatening
      complication. Some studies show that the surgical technique affects the
      haemorrhage rate. AIMS: To analyse the post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate, and
      to determine whether the effect of the surgical technique on the haemorrhage rate
      exists. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of all patients who underwent a
      tonsillectomy in three regional ENT departments in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Tuzla,
      Zenica and Bihac) between January 1(st) 2015 and October 31(st) 2016. Disorders
      which could affect the post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate were excluded.
      Tonsillectomy techniques used in these three centers were the hot technique
      (monopolar/bipolar forceps dissection and haemostasis) and the combined technique
      (cold steel dissection with monopolar/bipolar forceps haemostasis). RESULTS: 1087
      patients that underwent a tonsillectomy were analysed in this study. 864 (79.48%)
      of those were children. 922 (84.82%) patients were operated using the combined
      technique, 165 (15.17%) underwent a tonsillectomy using the hot technique.
      Post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage occured in 46 (4.23%) patients. 45 (4.88%)
      patients had a postoperative haemorrhage after tonsillectomy using the combined
      technique, whereas haemorrhage occured in 1 patient (0.6%) after using the hot
      technique. The haemorrhage rate was about eight times lower after tonsillectomy
      using the hot technique (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the surgical
      technique used for tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy with the lowest
      post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate is the hot technique; these results are
      statistically significant. This technique should be used whenever possible, in
      order to lower the risk of post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage.

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S41356 [doi]
AB  - Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. The
      efficacy and safety of statins in primary and secondary prevention of CHD is
      confirmed in several large studies, and rosuvastatin is the latest statin on
      market. We review the published literature on rosuvastatin in Chinese people. The
      pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in Chinese is somewhat different from that in
      Caucasians, but this does not influence the linear relationship between dosage
      and efficacy and with no drug accumulation. Rosuvastatin 5-20 mg/day is effective
      and safe in decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both younger and
      elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia, even in very elderly patients.
      Rosuvastatin also shows anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerosis features, such
      as reducing carotid intima-media thickness and plaque area. Rosuvastatin can also
      improve the prognosis of Chinese CHD patients, such as in the case of acute
      myocardial infarction. Its adverse-event rate is low and comparable to other
      statins. In conclusion, rosuvastatin is effective and safe for younger or elderly
      Chinese patients.

AB  - Pu-erh tea is a unique post-fermented tea processed from tender leaves of
      Camellia assamica. Characteristic component puerins were produced during the
      microbial fermentation process.This study focuses on the therapeutic effect and
      mechanism of puerin(P1) in Pu-erh tea on ApoE-/- mice with dyslipidemia and
      diabetes. It was found that P1 could significantly decreased total cholesterol
      (TC), triglyceride (TG) and fast blood glucose (FBG), and markedly improved
      impaired glucose tolerance (IPGTT) and insulin sensitivity (ITT) in
      hyperlipidemic and hyperglycemic ApoE-/- mice. Further experiments proved that P1
      reduced FBG and plasma TG levels by inhibiting intestinal alpha-glycosidase
      enzymes activity and by activating low-density lipoprotein receptor respectively.
      This study confirmed the therapeutic effect and mechanism of P1 on ApoE-/- mice
      with diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Based on the good efficacy of this compound, P1
      could be used as a new drug to treat the disorder of glycolipid metabolism.

TI  - Silibinin protects rat cardiac myocyte from isoproterenol-induced DNA damage
      independent on regulation of cell cycle.
PG  - 1900-5
AB  - Silibinin, derived from the milk thistle plant, Silybum marianum, has been
      traditionally used as an antihepatotoxic agent for the treatment of liver
      disease. Our preliminary study demonstrated that silibinin has protected rat
      cardiac myocytes against beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol-induced injury
      through resuming mitochondrial function and regulating the expression of SIRT1
      and Bcl-2 family members. In this study, we investigate whether silibinin has
      anti-apoptotic effect on isoproterenol-treated rat cardiac myocytes. DNA damage, 
      detected by the TUNEL and DNA fragmentation assay, was diminished after treatment
      of silibinin. Results of nitrite and Western blot assays showed that the amount
      of NO and the expression of iNOS were decreased after treatment with silibinin,
      while the expression of procaspase-3 and digestion of caspase-3 substrates, the
      inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP), were increased simultaneously. The DNA damage was reversed by
      down-regulation of p53 phosphorylation after treatment with silibinin. Result of 
      flowcytometric analysis showed that the cell cycle was not affected, and the
      expression of cell cycle regulatory protein p21 also had no change. Consequently,
      silibinin protected cardiac myocytes against isoproterenol-induced DNA damage
      through caspase pathway and the expression of p53, but independent on regulation 
      of cell cycle.

LID - S0036-36342012000500009 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To know the prevalence of malaria and the factors associated with the 
      infection in migrants in the southern border of Mexico, during 2008. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: In 706 migrants, active malaria infection was investigated using a
      rapid diagnostic test and PCR and past infection using serology. A questionnaire 
      was applied to investigate the conditions associated to infection. RESULTS: 85.6%
      originated from Central America, none presented an active infection, although
      4.2% were seropositive, most of these came from the countries with the highest
      malaria incidence in the region. Seropositivity was associated with the number of
      previous malaria episodes (OR=1.44; IC95% 1.04-2.00), years living in their
      community of origin (OR=1.03; IC95% 1.00-1.07), and knowledge and self-medication
      with anti-malaria drugs (OR=3.38; IC95% 1.48-7.67). CONCLUSIONS: . The previous
      exposure of migrants and the difficulties for their detection indicate the need
      of new strategies for the epidemiological surveillance for these populations.

TI  - The association between TNF-alpha 238A/G and 308A/G polymorphisms and juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis: An updated PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis.
PG  - e12883
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000012883 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A previous meta-analysis concluded that TNF-alpha 238A/G and TNF-alpha
      308A/G polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis (JIA) in the overall population or Caucasian subjects. With the
      publication of a fair number of studies on the association between TNF-alpha
      polymorphisms and JIA in recent years, we conducted this updated meta-analysis to
      make a more accurate evaluation of such relationship. METHODS: We adopted PubMed,
      EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and CNKI to identify observational studies that
      addressed the association between TNF-alpha polymorphisms and risk for JIA. The
      allelic effect of variant A for the risk of JIA was expressed as odds ratio (OR) 
      along with the associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Meta-analyses were
      performed by pooling ORs and 95%CI from included studies using RevMan 5.3
      software. The stratified-analysis based on ethnicity was performed to confirm the
      ethnicity-dependent effect on the relationship. RESULTS: A total of 15
      case-control studies including 2845 patients in JIA groups and 4771 patients in
      control groups were included in our study. The findings indicated a statistically
      significant association between the A allele of the TNF-alpha 238A/G polymorphism
      and the decreased JIA risk in Caucasians (P = .0002). The study in Iranian showed
      similar results (P = .0002) whereas the studies in other ethnicities failed to
      replicate this finding: Han (P = .29), Mexican (P = .64) and Turkish population
      (P = .32). TNF-alpha 308A/G was not statistically associated with JIA in overall 
      subjects or Caucasians. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the protective role of
      the A allele in TNF-alpha 238A/G but not TNF-alpha 308A/G against the occurrence 
      of JIA in the Caucasian population. To exactly validate the correlation between
      TNF-alpha polymorphisms and JIA in other ethnic backgrounds, additional studies
      are required.

TI  - Learning to avoid spiders: fear predicts performance, not competence.
PG  - 1291-1303
LID - 10.1080/02699931.2017.1411784 [doi]
AB  - We used an immersive virtual environment to examine avoidance learning in
      spider-fearful participants. In 3 experiments, participants were asked to
      repeatedly lift one of 3 virtual boxes, under which either a toy car or a spider 
      appeared and then approached the participant. Participants were not told that the
      probability of encountering a spider differed across boxes. When the difference
      was large (Exps. 1 and 2), spider-fearfuls learned to avoid spiders by lifting
      the few-spiders-box more often and the many-spiders-box less often than
      non-fearful controls did. However, they hardly managed to do so when the
      probability differences were small (Exp. 3), and they did not escape from threat 
      more quickly (Exp. 2). In contrast to the observed performance differences,
      spider-fearfuls and non-fearfuls showed equal competence, that is comparable
      post-experimental knowledge about the probability to encounter spiders under the 
      3 boxes. The limitations and implications of the present study are discussed.

PG  - 157-63
LID - 10.1177/1043659614526758 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to learn about the perspectives on 
      end-of-life decision making among older Chinese people in Macau. METHOD: A
      qualitative approach was used, and interviews were conducted with 18 Chinese aged
      65 years or older. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified: (a)
      institutionalized care at the end of life was preferred as not to be a burden on 
      family, (b) life-prolonging measures were not preferred, (c) funeral arrangement 
      preferences were based on personal and religious beliefs, and (d) end-of-life
      decision making would be deferred to others. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These
      themes provide an understanding of personal preferences of older Chinese on
      end-of-life issues, and personal preferences are always secondary to their
      respect toward family and medical doctors. This compliance with family and
      medical authority can be understood through Chinese cultural beliefs.
      IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Knowledge of cultural influences is needed for nursing
      professionals to deal effectively with older adults and families regarding
      end-of-life issues.

TI  - A preliminary investigation of the impact of oily skin on quality of life and
      concordance of self-perceived skin oiliness and skin surface lipids (sebum).
PG  - 442-7
LID - 10.1111/ics.12063 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This preliminary study investigated both the impact of oily skin on
      quality of life (QoL) and the agreement between subjective oily skin
      self-assessment and objective skin surface sebum measurement in young to
      middle-aged Chinese women in Beijing. METHODS: A 18-item Chinese version of the
      Oily Skin Self-Image Questionnaire (OSSIQ) was used to assess the impact of oily 
      skin on QoL in 300 healthy female subjects (age groups: 20-25; 26-30; 31-35,).
      The subjects were divided equally into the oily skin group and the non-oily skin 
      group based on their self-perception of skin oiliness. The level of skin surface 
      lipids (SSL) was measured on the middle of the forehead, and both cheeks using
      the Sebumeter((R)). In order to assess the agreement between self-perceived skin 
      oiliness and measured SSL, we tentatively used the SSL median value as a dividing
      point to regroup all subjects. RESULTS: The results indicate that the Chinese
      version of the OSSIQ distinguished the oily skin group from the non-oily skin
      group. Subjects in the oily skin group had significant higher emotional status
      score and behavior score when compared with subjects in the non-oily skin group. 
      Subjects in the oily skin group had higher SSL when compared with subjects in the
      non-oily skin group, especially in younger age groups. The agreement between
      self-perceived skin oiliness and measured SSL was moderately strong in younger
      age groups, and declined with age. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest
      that having oily skin can cause a significant negative impact on QoL among
      Chinese women. The Chinese version of the OSSIQ is a reliable and valid tool for 
      assessing the impact of oily skin on QoL. The accuracy of oily skin
      self-assessment declines with age.

TI  - Solid Pseudopapillary Tumor of the Pancreas - Rare Neoplastic Disease in
      20-Year-Old Woman.
PG  - 376-379
LID - 10.14735/amko2018376 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Benign cystic tumors represent only 2% of all pancreatic tumors
      (pancreatic cancer - PC). In contrast to malignant cystic tumors, these tumors
      occur typically in young women. A solid pseudopapillary tumor is a relatively
      rare affliction representing less than 4% of cystic PC. Although the tumor is
      considered benign, metastasis, especially to the spleen, has been reported in
      approximately 0.5-4% patients. Despite R0 resection, vascular and perineural
      invasion is monitored in 20% of cases. Invasion is the cause of tumor relapse in 
      up to one third of affected patients. Characteristic features of the disease are 
      latent clinical indicators such as signs of pain and malfunction of intestinal
      passage. The diagnostics is based on MR, sometimes in combination with positron
      emission tomography. Medical treatment is specifically surgical. CASE HISTORY:
      Authors present a case of a 20-year-old female patient who was examined due to
      pain in the epigastrium, further exasperated by a voluminous expansion of the
      abdominal cavity. An initial ultra-sonographic examination was conducted to
      examine for possible nodular focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver; however, an 
      MRI scan revealed the likelihood of a malignant tumor in the subhepatic region.
      During laparotomy, a tumor protruding from the head of the pancreas was
      discovered and removed. Histological examination showed it was a solid
      pseudopapillary pancreatic tumor. After a month of good post-operative progress, 
      the patient was re-operated because of the presence of pancreatic fistula.
      Complete healing of the fistula was achieved after total parenteral nutrition and
      administration of sandostatin. At her last examination, the patient was without
      any problems. CONCLUSION: Solid pseudopapillary pancreatic tumors are rare,
      mainly benign lesions. It is essential to consider them in the differential
      diagnostics of afflictions of the subhepatic region, especially in young women.
      The only generally accepted cure nowadays is surgical resection. It is necessary 
      to monitor patients consistently considering the rather high frequency of relapse
      of disease despite R0 resections. In the case of surgical removal, the 5-year
      survival rate is near 97%. Key words: solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas -
      diagnostics - therapy The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of
      interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study. The Editorial
      Board declares that the manuscript met the ICMJE recommendation for biomedical

TI  - Cure of myeloma: hype or reality?
PG  - 215-24
AB  - High-dose treatment (HDT) with autologous stem cell transplant(s) (ASCT) improved
      survival, when compared to standard treatment, in multiple myeloma patients.
      Although the superiority of HDT is clearly recognized by the medical community,
      what is less appreciated is the disproportionate benefit enjoyed (as a result of 
      this approach) by various patient subgroups. As the clinical heterogeneity of
      myeloma can be currently traced to its underlying genetic features,
      prognostically different patient groups can be identified largely based on the
      presence of adverse cytogenetic abnormalities and high serum levels of lactate
      dehydrogenase at baseline (high-risk features). While HDT applied to high-risk
      patients leads to modest survival gains, the same treatment, as the backbone of a
      comprehensive approach, can be curative in a minority of low-risk patients. A
      third group of low-risk patients will enjoy rather prolonged (10-year) survival, 
      interrupted, however, by responsive relapses. In a manner analogous to follicular
      lymphoma, this latter group may transform to a more aggressive disease,
      characterized by the new acquisition of adverse cytogenetic abnormalities.
      Improving the complete response rate in these patients, by integrating newer
      therapeutic agents, may increase their cure rate. Currently non-myeloablative,
      allogeneic transplants (and possibly proteasome inhibitors) are the most
      promising approaches for high-risk patients.

TI  - Re-evaluation of putative rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility genes in the
      post-genome wide association study era and hypothesis of a key pathway underlying
      susceptibility.
PG  - 2274-9
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn128 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an archetypal, common, complex autoimmune disease
      with both genetic and environmental contributions to disease aetiology. Two novel
      RA susceptibility loci have been reported from recent genome-wide and candidate
      gene association studies. We, therefore, investigated the evidence for
      association of the STAT4 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA using imputed data from the
      Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). No evidence for association of
      variants mapping to the TRAF1/C5 gene was detected in the 1860 RA cases and 2930 
      control samples tested in that study. Variants mapping to the STAT4 gene did show
      evidence for association (rs7574865, P = 0.04). Given the association of the
      TRAF1/C5 locus in two previous large case-control series from populations of
      European descent and the evidence for association of the STAT4 locus in the WTCCC
      study, single nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to these loci were tested for
      association with RA in an independent UK series comprising DNA from >3000 cases
      with disease and >3000 controls and a combined analysis including the WTCCC data 
      was undertaken. We confirm association of the STAT4 and the TRAF1/C5 loci with RA
      bringing to 5 the number of confirmed susceptibility loci. The effect sizes are
      less than those reported previously but are likely to be a more accurate
      reflection of the true effect size given the larger size of the cohort
      investigated in the current study.

TI  - An Apgar scoring system for routine assessment of newborn puppy viability and
      short-term survival prognosis.
PG  - 401-7
LID - 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.03.010 [doi]
AB  - The Apgar scoring system is an easy and reliable method for evaluating both human
      and animal neonates. However, its use is not widespread in veterinary medicine.
      The current study assessed a modified Apgar scoring system for routine evaluation
      of newborn puppies. Heart rate, respiratory effort, reflex irritability,
      motility, and mucus color have been evaluated in the score. Specifically, we used
      5 min after birth Apgar score to assess newborn viability and short-term survival
      prognosis, as well as related characteristics, in 193 puppies from 42 litters, 65
      born by spontaneous delivery, 66 by assisted delivery, and 62 by cesarean
      section. The percentage of puppies that were dead 2h after birth was higher in
      the 4 to 6 Apgar score group versus that in the 7 to 10 score group (P<0.01) and 
      in the 0 to 3 score group versus that in the 7 to 10 score group (P<0.0001).
      Delivery method did not affect survival. There was a marked reduction in the
      number of puppies searching for the mammary gland in the 0 to 3 and 4 to 6 Apgar 
      score groups compared with that in the 7 to 10 score group (P<0.0001); there was 
      a difference between the 0 to 3 and the 4 to 6 score groups as well (P<0.05).
      Suckling/swallowing reflexes were present in fewer puppies in the 0 to 3 and 4 to
      6 score groups compared with that in the 7 to 10 group (P<0.0001), with no
      significant differences between the 0 to 3 and the 4 to 6 score groups.

      compounds 4a-e were thus obtained. The new compounds were characterized using IR,
      (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, UV and MS spectral data. In addition, the newly synthesized 
      compounds 3a-g were titrated potentiometrically with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide
      in four non-aqueous solvents such as isopropyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol,
      acetone and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and the half-neutralization potential
      values and the corresponding pKa values were determined for all cases. Moreover, 
      3 and 4 type compounds were also screened for their antioxidant activities.

TI  - The complex puzzle underlying the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes:
      from molecular basis to clinical manifestations.
PG  - 1533-43
LID - 10.1586/erc.12.157 [doi]
AB  - Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) still represent a major cause of death in Western 
      countries; in the vast majority of cases, coronary atherosclerosis represents the
      common pathological lesion to all forms of ACS. It is currently believed that
      plaque complication (rupture, fissuration, and so on), with the consequent
      superimposed thrombosis, is a key factor ultimately leading to the clinical
      occurrence of ACS. Over the last two decades, our understanding of the basic
      mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of ACS has progressed significantly
      and the crucial role of inflammation in this phenomenon is now widely recognized.
      The sequence of events is represented by plaque complication (i.e., rupture,
      fissuration or erosion), exposure of tissue factor and other prothrombotic
      substances, such as von Willebrand factor and collagen, to the blood flow,
      activation of platelets and of the coagulation cascade and thrombus formation
      within the coronary artery. However, not all complicated plaques cause the
      clinical occurrence of ACS and similar complicated plaques may cause different
      clinical manifestations. A complex interaction between different factors, such as
      arterial vessel wall substrates, degree of inflammation of the culprit lesion,
      local rheological characteristics of blood flow, as well as factors present in
      the circulating blood, will determine the severity (complete vs incomplete
      occlusion) and the persistence of coronary blood flow cessation, which, in turn, 
      will be largely responsible for the clinical picture. Targeting tissue factor,
      the key player in the activation of the coagulation cascade, may represent an
      important therapeutic strategy to prevent the clinical manifestation of ACS.

TI  - Revisiting self-regulatory techniques to promote physical activity in older
      adults: null-findings from a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1145-65
LID - 10.1080/08870446.2016.1185523 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate a
      three-hour face-to-face physical activity (PA) intervention in community-dwelling
      older German adults with four groups: The intervention group (IG) received
      behaviour change techniques (BCTs) based on the health action process approach
      plus a views-on-ageing component to increase PA. The second intervention group
      'planning' (IGpl) contained the same BCTs, only substituted the views-on-ageing
      component against an additional planning task. An active control group received
      the same BCTs, however, targeting volunteering instead of PA. A passive control
      group (PCG) received no intervention. DESIGN: The RCT comprised 5 time-points
      over 14 months in N = 310 participants aged 64+. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Self-reported as well as accelerometer-assessed PA. RESULTS: Neither PA measure
      increased in the IG as compared to the other groups at any point in time. Bayes
      analyses supported these null-effects. CONCLUSION: A possible explanation for
      this null-finding in line with a recent meta-analysis is that some
      self-regulatory BCTs may be ineffective or even negatively associated with PA in 
      interventions for older adults as they are assumed to be less acceptable for
      older adults. This interpretation was supported by observed reluctance to
      participate in self-regulatory BCTs in the current study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to verify if extra virgin olive oil and fish
      oil have a synergistic effect on lipid and oxidative stress parameters in
      patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: This intervention study
      included 102 patients (81 women and 21 men) with MetS (mean age 51.45 +/- 8.27 y)
      from the ambulatory center of the University Hospital of Londrina, Parana,
      Brazil. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Patients in the
      control group (CG) were instructed to maintain their usual diet; the second group
      (fish oil group [FO]) received 3 g/d of fish oil omega-3 fatty acids (10
      capsules); the third group (extra virgin olive oil group [OO]) received 10 mL/d
      of extra virgin olive oil at lunch and dinner; and the fourth group (fish oil and
      extra virgin olive oil group [FOO]) received 3 g/d of fish oil omega-3 fatty
      acids and 10 mL/d of extra virgin olive oil. MetS related markers and oxidative
      stress were measured at baseline and after 90 d. RESULTS: Differences across
      treatment groups showed a statistically significant decrease (P < 0.05) in total 
      cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) when FOO was
      compared with CG and OO, respectively. Hydroperoxides showed a significant
      decrease (P < 0.05) when FOO was compared with CG, whereas there was an increase 
      in total peroxyl radical-trapping antioxidant potential/advanced oxidation
      protein products (TRAP/AOPP; P < 0.05) in FOO when compared with FO. In relation 
      to baseline values, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in LDL-C values, 
      and TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C/HDL-C indexes in
      FOO. There was also a decrease (P < 0.05) in hydroperoxides, in AOPP and in
      AOPP/TRAP index in FOO, and an increase (P < 0.05) in TRAP/AOPP index in FOO and 
      in TRAP/uric acid ratio in OO. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence
      that increased dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and extra virgin olive
      oil have beneficial synergistic effects on lipid metabolism and oxidative stress 
      in patients with MetS.

TI  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome following cardiovascular surgery: current
      concepts and novel therapeutic approaches.
PG  - 94-100
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000000283 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review gives an update on current treatment options and
      novel concepts on the prevention and treatment of the acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome (ARDS) in cardiovascular surgery patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The only
      proven beneficial therapeutic options in ARDS are those that help to prevent
      further ventilator-induced lung injury, such as prone position, use of
      lung-protective ventilation strategies, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 
      In the future also new approaches like mesenchymal cell therapy, activation of
      hypoxia-elicited transcription factors or targeting of purinergic signaling may
      be successful outside the experimental setting. Owing to the so far limited
      treatment options, it is of great importance to determine patients at risk for
      developing ARDS already perioperatively. In this context, serum biomarkers and
      lung injury prediction scores could be useful. SUMMARY: Preventing ARDS as a
      severe complication in the cardiovascular surgery setting may help to reduce
      morbidity and mortality. As cardiovascular surgery patients are of greater risk
      to develop ARDS, preventive interventions should be implemented early on.
      Especially, use of low tidal volumes, avoiding of fluid overload and restrictive 
      blood transfusion regimes may help to prevent ARDS.

TI  - Low-dose dobutamine tissue-tagged magnetic resonance imaging with 3-dimensional
      strain analysis allows assessment of myocardial viability in patients with
      ischemic cardiomyopathy.
PG  - I33-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tissue-tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with 3-dimensional
      (3D) myocardial strain analysis allows quantitative assessment of myocardial
      contractility. We assessed the hypothesis that 3D strain determination at rest
      and with low-dose dobutamine would discriminate between viable and nonviable
      myocardium in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). METHODS AND RESULTS:
      MRI with radiofrequency tissue-tagging at rest and with low-dose dobutamine was
      performed in 16 normal volunteers and 14 patients with ICM. Three-dimensional
      global and regional circumferential strains (Ecc) were computed for all subjects 
      at rest and with dobutamine. Results were compared with clinically indicated
      conventional viability studies. Compared with normal volunteers, global left
      ventricular Ecc was significantly decreased in patients with ICM at rest
      (-0.15+/-0.06 versus -0.27+/-0.03; P<0.001) and with dobutamine (-0.17+/-0.08
      versus -0.37+/-0.10; P<0.001). Ecc was significantly decreased in nonviable
      regions compared with viable segments at rest (-0.08+/-0.06 versus -0.17+/-0.10; 
      P<0.001) and with dobutamine (-0.07+/-0.06 versus -0.21+/-0.11; P<0.001). Ecc in 
      viable segments increased significantly in response to dobutamine (P=0.04),
      whereas Ecc did not change in nonviable segments (P=0.50). Normal controls (96
      segments) had increased Ecc at rest (-0.27+/-0.07) and with dobutamine
      (-0.37+/-0.15) compared with both viable and nonviable regions in ICM patients
      (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive dobutamine tissue-tagged MRI with calculation
      of 3D strain allows the identification, quantification and display of regionally 
      varying ventricular function. The response of systolic strain to low-dose
      dobutamine has significant promise in discriminating between viable and nonviable
      myocardium.

TI  - The fungal phytochrome FphA from Aspergillus nidulans.
PG  - 34605-14
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M805506200 [doi]
AB  - The red light-sensing photoreceptor FphA from Aspergillus nidulans is involved in
      the regulation of developmental processes in response to light. Here we present
      extended biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of recombinant FphA using
      a synthetic gene with host-adapted codon usage. The recombinant photosensory
      domain FphAN753 was shown to display all features of a bona fide phytochrome. It 
      covalently binds biliverdin as chromophore and undergoes red/far-red
      light-inducible photoconversion with both parent states being protonated. The
      large N-terminal variable extension of FphA exerts a stabilizing effect on the
      active Pfr state. Upon substitution of the highly conserved histidine 504,
      involved in the hydrogen-bonding network of the protein moiety and the
      chromophore, chromophore attachment and photoreversibility were completely
      impaired. FphA is a functional sensor histidine kinase with a strong
      red-light-dependent autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, intermolecular
      trans-phosphorylation to the response regulator domain of a second monomer could 
      be demonstrated. Interestingly, co-incubation of FphA and FphA variants led to
      enhanced autophosphorylation, including the "inactive" Pr form. The latter
      observed phenomenon might suggest that auto- and trans-phosphorylation activity
      is modulated by additional interaction partners leading to variable
      phosphorylation events that trigger a specific output response.

AB  - This video provides a case report of a 16-year-old male patient who underwent
      bladder enlargement with a catheterized conduit under Macedo's technique. This
      technique involves the use of a segment of the distal ileum with a flap that is
      used for confection of the conduit. Key points include: 1) skin incision
      planning; 2) bladder release to allow a tension-free anastomosis; 3) reservoir
      and a conduit creation with a distal ileum; and 4) creation of a continence
      mechanism.

TI  - Exploring wastewater system performance under future threats: Does enhancing
      resilience increase sustainability?
PG  - 448-459
LID - S0043-1354(18)30946-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.025 [doi]
AB  - Sustainability and resilience are both key considerations in the design and
      operation of wastewater systems. However, there is currently a lack of
      understanding of the relationship between these two goals and of the effects of
      increasing resilience on sustainability. This paper, therefore, presents a
      framework for analysis of the effects of resilience-enhancing interventions on
      sustainability, and applies this to an urban wastewater system. Given that
      sustainability addresses the long term, the framework includes a novel
      sustainability assessment approach which captures a continuum of potential future
      conditions and enables identification of tipping points where applicable. This
      method allows a wide range of potential futures to be captured whilst removing
      the need to develop scenarios or future projections. While it may be possible to 
      develop interventions that are beneficial in terms of their effects on both
      resilience and sustainability, the results obtained from the case study
      demonstrate that implementing measures designed to increase resilience of an
      integrated urban wastewater system does not guarantee a universal improvement in 
      sustainability. Therefore, when proposing measures to increase resilience, the
      potential effects on sustainability should be considered also. It is also shown
      that the extent of any negative effects on system sustainability can vary
      significantly depending on future conditions, with the case study intervention
      (increasing pump capacity) achieving the highest degree of sustainability if
      rainfall depths or imperviousness in the catchments reduce. However, trade-offs
      between sustainability indicators are present irrespective of future conditions. 
      Furthermore, while an intervention that enhances resilience may be considered
      sustainable with respect to specific indicators under current conditions, tipping
      points exist and it will cease to be sustainable if future threat magnitudes
      exceed these.

TI  - Epidemiology of cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet: modeling disease dynamics
      within and between individual plants.
PG  - 1550-7
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-97-12-1550 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT Disease dynamics of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) of sugar beet was
      analyzed at two hierarchical scales: as vertical profiles within individual
      plants and in relation to disease on neighboring plants. The relative
      contribution of different leaf layers to increase in CLS was analyzed using a
      simple continuous-time model. The model was fitted to data from two field trials 
      in the Netherlands: one in an area with a long history of CLS, the other in an
      area where CLS has only recently established; in each case these were unsprayed
      and twice-sprayed treatments. There were differences in the relative contribution
      of different leaf layers to disease increase on the target leaf layer according
      to the CLS history and whether the plants were sprayed or unsprayed. In both
      field trials, parameter estimates giving the relative contribution of the target 
      leaf layer to disease increase at that leaf layer were higher than those for the 
      lower leaf layer. On only a few occasions the contribution of an upper leaf layer
      to disease increase at the target leaf layer was significant. Thus, CLS increase 
      at the target leaf layer was determined mainly by disease severity at that leaf
      layer and to a lesser extent by disease at the lower leaf layer. Our
      continuous-time model was also used to analyze CLS increase on an individual
      sugar beet plant in relation to its own and its neighbor's level of disease in
      field trials at five locations in the two CLS areas over two years. In all field 
      trials, the contribution of the target plant itself to disease increase
      (auto-infection) was larger than that of its neighboring plants (allo-infection).
      The overall analysis in the two CLS areas also indicated a larger contribution of
      the target plant to its disease increase than of neighboring plants, and this
      pattern was also apparent in a pooled analysis across all sites. Thus, CLS
      increase on a sugar beet plant was mainly determined by the disease severity on
      that plant and to a lesser extent by its within-row neighboring plants.

TI  - The Use of Cone Beam Computed Tomography in Assessing the Insertion of Bone
      Conduction Hearing Implants.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2017.00038 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare postoperative cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging 
      to implant stability quotient (ISQ) measurement and direct caliper measurements
      as a suitable technique to assess bone conduction hearing implant (BCHI) seating 
      and insertion depth. METHODS: In vitro, BCHIs were completely (n = 9) and
      partially inserted (n = 9) in bone blocks of different densities and subsequently
      scanned. Scans were processed using 3DSlicer 4.3.1 and Mathematica 10.3. ISQ
      measurements were obtained for all BCHIs mounted with different abutment lengths 
      (9, 12, and 14 mm). CBCT imaging was performed for patients with a clinical
      indication. RESULTS: In vitro, 95% prediction intervals for partially inserted
      and completely inserted BCHIs were determined. ISQ values significantly decreased
      with partial insertion, low-density artificial bone, and longer abutment lengths.
      Evaluation of in vitro and in vivo 3D models allowed for assessment of insertion 
      depth and inclination. CONCLUSION: CBCT imaging allows to study implant seating
      and insertion depth after BCHI surgery. This can be useful when visual
      confirmation is limited. It is possible to distinguish a partial BCHI insertion
      from a complete insertion in artificial bone blocks. This technique could prove
      to be a valuable research tool. In vitro, ISQ values for Ponto BCHIs relate to
      abutment length, insertion depth, and artificial bone density.

TI  - Splenectomy reduces fibrosis and preneoplastic lesions with increased
      triglycerides and essential fatty acids in rat liver cirrhosis induced by a
      choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet.
PG  - 463-74
LID - 10.1111/j.1872-034X.2011.00784.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study investigated whether splenectomy is of significance in
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). METHODS: Five-week-old Wistar rats were fed
      a choline-deficient diet for 8 weeks to create a NASH model. A sham-operation or 
      splenectomy was then performed, and rats were killed 4 weeks later. RESULTS:
      Liver fibrosis and liver preneoplastic lesions were significantly reduced in the 
      splenectomy group compared to the sham-operation group, and alpha-smooth muscle
      actin (SMA) expression was significantly inhibited (liver fibrosis area: sham
      8.63 +/- 4.09%, splenectomy 5.45 +/- 3.69%, P < 0.01; preneoplastic lesion size: 
      sham 6.56 +/- 3.68 x10(6) microm(2) /cm(2) , splenectomy 4.63 +/- 3.27 x10(6)
      microm(2) /cm(2) , P < 0.05; the number of preneoplastic lesions: sham 8.33 +/-
      3.96/cm(2) , splenectomy 5.17 +/- 1.80/cm(2) , P < 0.01; alpha-smooth muscle
      actin-positive area: sham 4.41 +/- 2.48%, splenectomy 2.75 +/- 1.66%, P < 0.01)
      On the other hand, liver triglycerides and essential fatty acids were
      significantly increased in the splenectomy group (liver triglycerides: sham 182
      +/- 35.0 mg/g, splenectomy 230 +/- 35.0 mg/g, P < 0.05; liver linoleic acid: sham
      17.2 +/- 4.9 mg/g, splenectomy 23.3 +/- 6.9 mg/g, P < 0.05; liver alpha-linolenic
      acid: sham 118 +/- 36.6 microg/g, splenectomy 162 +/- 51.4 microg/g, P < 0.05).
      In addition, expressions of hepatic fatty acid metabolism-related genes (e.g.
      acyl-CoA oxidase, liver carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I, cytochrome P450
      4A, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase)
      were significantly inhibited in the splenectomy group. CONCLUSION: These findings

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Human adult bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells
      (hMSC) are reported to break germ layer commitment and differentiate into cells
      expressing neuroectodermal properties. Although it is of pivotal interest for
      cell replacement therapies for neurologic disorders, no data exist on the
      influence of the donor's age on this multipotent differentiation behavior.
      METHODS: We evaluated various epigenetic neuroectodermal conversion protocols in 
      adult hMSC derived from older donors (>45 versus 18-35 years of age) using
      quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
      immunocytochemistry. The protocols included single- and multi-step
      conversion-differentiation protocols combined with co-culture techniques.
      Furthermore, the age dependency of mesodermal differentiation potential and cell 
      senescence were investigated. RESULTS: The neuroectodermal differentiation
      potential of hMSC derived from old donors was completely lost, with no cells
      showing mature neuroectodermal phenotypes using single- and multi-step
      conversion-differentiation protocols and no improvement of neurogenesis by
      various co-culture conditions. Comparison of young versus old donor-derived hMSC 
      showed fewer cells expressing early neuroectodermal marker proteins in the latter
      samples. qRT-PCR showed reduced expression of the proliferation marker KI67 and
      the neuroectodermal gene NES (nestin) in old donor-derived cells compared with
      young donor hMSC. Telomere length analysis showed no general cell aging.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that only young donor-derived hMSC can be 
      epigenetically differentiated in vitro into neuroectodermal cells, pointing
      towards senescence of multipotentiality of old donor-derived hMSC. There is thus 
      an urgent need to develop better protocols for successful neuroectodermal
      differentiation of hMSC from old individuals as a prerequisite for autologous
      cell replacement strategies for neurologic diseases in elderly patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The interplay between arousals and respiratory events during
      Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) with central sleep apnea (CSA) in heart failure
      (HF) patients is still not fully understood. We investigated the temporal
      relationship between arousals and CSR-CSA. METHODS: Episodes of CSR-CSA during
      sleep stages N1-N2 were analyzed in 22 HF patients with an apnea-hypopnea index
      >/=15/h, dominant CSA and central apnea index >/=5/h. For each CSR-CSA cycle
      (apnea+hyperpnea), we determined the onset (ARonset, relative to hyperpnea onset)
      and duration of detected arousals. RESULTS: Arousals (N=2348) mostly occurred
      within the first half of the hyperpneic phase (42.6%, ARonset=10.6+/-2.1s;
      duration=10.6+/-5.2s) or close to hyperpnea onset (21.5%, ARonset=-0.1+/-0.6s;
      duration=13.9+/-5.4s). Within-apnea arousals were less frequent (12.4%,
      ARonset=-16.0+/-4.7s; duration=3.8+/-1.4s). The proportion of CSR-CSA cycles
      without any hyperpnea-related arousal was 27.5+/-18.2%. Hyperpnea-related
      arousability (total number of hyperpneic arousals/total duration of hyperpneas)
      and apnea-related arousability were 63.4+/-21.0/h and 23.8+/-16.9/h, respectively
      (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: During CSR-CSA, a significant proportion of arousals
      occur at hyperpnea onset, indicating a low arousal threshold. Hyperpneic arousals
      are not essential for CSR-CSA. Arousability markedly increases during hyperpneas,
      likely due to the concurrent increase in chemoreceptor stimulation. SIGNIFICANCE:
      This study extends current knowledge on the interplay between sleep instability
      and respiratory events during CSR-CSA.

PG  - 193-203
LID - 10.1042/BJ20112026 [doi]
AB  - Recombinant muscle GYS1 (glycogen synthase 1) and recombinant liver GYS2 were
      phosphorylated by recombinant AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) in a
      time-dependent manner and to a similar stoichiometry. The phosphorylation site in
      GYS2 was identified as Ser7, which lies in a favourable consensus for
      phosphorylation by AMPK. Phosphorylation of GYS1 or GYS2 by AMPK led to enzyme
      inactivation by decreasing the affinity for both UDP-Glc (UDP-glucose) [assayed
      in the absence of Glc-6-P (glucose-6-phosphate)] and Glc-6-P (assayed at low
      UDP-Glc concentrations). Incubation of freshly isolated rat hepatocytes with the 
      pharmacological AMPK activators AICA riboside
      (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside) or A769662 led to
      persistent GYS inactivation and Ser7 phosphorylation, whereas inactivation by
      glucagon treatment was transient. In hepatocytes from mice harbouring a
      liver-specific deletion of the AMPK catalytic alpha1/alpha2 subunits, GYS2
      inactivation by AICA riboside and A769662 was blunted, whereas inactivation by
      glucagon was unaffected. The results suggest that GYS inactivation by AMPK
      activators in hepatocytes is due to GYS2 Ser7 phosphorylation.

TI  - In vivo evaluation of adeno-associated virus gene transfer in airways of mice
      with acute or chronic respiratory infection.
PG  - 966-76
LID - 10.1089/hum.2014.002 [doi]
AB  - Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) often suffer chronic lung infection with
      concomitant inflammation, a setting that may reduce the efficacy of gene
      transfer. While gene therapy development for CF often involves viral-based
      vectors, little is known about gene transfer in the context of an infected
      airway. In this study, three mouse models were established to evaluate
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer in such an environment. Bordetella
      bronchiseptica RB50 was used in a chronic, nonlethal respiratory infection in
      C57BL/6 mice. An inoculum of approximately 10(5) CFU allowed B. bronchiseptica
      RB50 to persist in the upper and lower respiratory tracts for at least 21 days.
      In this infection model, administration of an AAV vector on day 2 resulted in
      2.8-fold reduction of reporter gene expression compared with that observed in
      uninfected controls. Postponement of AAV administration to day 14 resulted in an 
      even greater (eightfold) reduction of reporter gene expression, when compared
      with uninfected controls. In another infection model, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1
      was used to infect surfactant protein D (SP-D) or surfactant protein A (SP-A)
      knockout (KO) mice. With an inoculum of approximately 10(5) CFU, infection
      persisted for 2 days in the nasal cavity of either mouse model. Reporter gene
      expression was approximately approximately 2.5-fold lower compared with
      uninfected mice. In the SP-D KO model, postponement of AAV administration to day 
      9 postinfection resulted in only a two fold reduction in reporter gene
      expression, when compared with expression seen in uninfected controls. These
      results confirm that respiratory infections, both ongoing and recently resolved, 
      decrease the efficacy of AAV-mediated gene transfer.

TI  - Hydrothermal synthesis of SrTiO3 nanoplates through epitaxial self-assembly of
      nanocubes.
PG  - 2685-90
AB  - SrTiO3 nanoplates are obtained by the precipitation of an aqueous gel suspension.
      The gel suspension is prepared by hydrolysis of a Titanium isopropoxide
      [Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4] solution with NaOH and the addition of Sr(NO3)2. The amount of
      additive oleic acid plays a significant role in the formation of pure SrTiO3
      phase with specific morphologies. The results of transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM) and electron diffraction (ED) investigations provide evidences that the
      oriented aggregation of small nanocubes is the dominant growth mechanism for the 
      formation of the observed SrTiO3 nanoplates. The primary nanocrystals are
      self-assembled in a highly oriented fashion, producing defective single-crystal
      particles. The above results show that the directional aggregation process can be
      controlled by changing the temperature of the suspension as well as by adding
      organic molecules, by which the SrTiO3 particles can be obtained with a
      controlled size and shape.

TI  - Algorithms for matching 3D line sets.
PG  - 582-93
AB  - Matching two sets of lines is a basic tool that has applications in many computer
      vision problems such as scene registration, object recognition, motion
      estimation, and others. Line sets may be composed of infinitely long lines or
      finite length line segments. Depending on line lengths, three basic cases arise
      in matching sets of lines: 1) finite-finite, 2) finite-infinite, and 3)
      infinite-infinite. Case 2 has not been treated in the literature. For Cases 1 and
      3, existing algorithms for matching 3D line sets are not completely satisfactory 
      in that they either solve special situations, or give approximate solutions, or
      may not converge, or are not invariant with respect to coordinate system
      transforms. In this paper, we present new algorithms that solve exactly all three
      cases for the general situation. The algorithms are provably convergent and
      invariant to coordinate transforms. Experiments with synthetic and real 3D image 
      data are reported.

TI  - Study of the immunological profile towards Mycobacterium bovis antigens in
      naturally infected cattle.
PG  - 460-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2009.00141.x [doi]
AB  - A number of studies have determined the contribution of Th1 and Th2 responses to 
      the protective immunity and pathology of Mycobacterium bovis infection. However, 
      much of that information is derived from experimentally infecting cattle with M. 
      bovis and few data from naturally infected animals are available. The aim of this
      study was to characterize the immunological profile towards M. bovis antigens of 
      naturally infected cattle by measurement of cytokine mRNA expression in PBMC, and
      to determine which lymphocyte subsets are involved in recall responses of PBMC
      from M. bovis infected cattle to M. bovis antigens. Consistent with data from
      cattle experimentally infected with M. bovis, naturally infected animals were
      found to display a Th1 cytokine profile in response to M. bovis PPDB stimulation.
      Production of IFN-gamma mRNA by PBMC after PPDB stimulation statistically
      distinguishes between infected and healthy herds, suggesting that this molecule
      is usable as an M. bovis-infection marker. As happens in experimentally infected 
      cows, CD4, CD8 and gammadeltaTCR cells from a herd naturally infected with M.
      bovis are the predominant T cell subsets expanded in response to PPDB.

TI  - A scale to assist the diagnosis of autism and Asperger's disorder in adults
      (RAADS): a pilot study.
PG  - 213-23
AB  - An empirically based 78 question self-rating scale based on DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 
      criteria was developed to assist clinicians' diagnosis of adults with autism and 
      Asperger's Disorder-the Ritvo Autism and Asperger's Diagnostic Scale (RAADS). It 
      was standardized on 17 autistic and 20 Asperger's Disorder and 57 comparison
      subjects. Both autistic and Asperger's groups scored significantly higher than
      comparison groups with no overlap; sensitivity, specificity, and content validity
      equaled one. Cronbach's alpha coefficients of internal consistency of three
      subscales were satisfactory. Gender, age, and diagnostic categories were not
      significantly associated factors. The RAADS can be administered and scored in
      less than an hour and may be useful as a clinical scale to assist identification 
      of autism and Asperger's Disorder in adults. The RAADS does not distinguish
      between autism and Asperger's Disorder.

TI  - Objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children with
      bronchiectasis: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s12890-018-0772-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is a major contributor to respiratory morbidity and
      health care utilization in children and youth. Current treatment guidelines for
      bronchiectasis recommend participation in regular physical activity (PA) to
      improve aerobic fitness and quality of life (QoL). However, no previous study has
      assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior in this patient group, and the 
      extent to which children with bronchiectasis meet guidelines for PA is unknown.
      In the absence of such data, we objectively measured the PA of children with
      bronchiectasis and compared them to current guidelines. METHODS: Forty-six
      children with bronchiectasis between 4 to 14 years (mean age 7.5 +/- 2.6 years)
      were recruited from the Queensland Children's Hospital, Brisbane. Daily time in
      sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was measured objectively
      over 7 days using the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer and compared their values to 
      current guidelines (minimum 60 min of MVPA daily). Compliance with the daily
      guideline and average daily steps counts were compared to normative data from two
      population-based health surveys of healthy children. RESULTS: We had complete
      measurements from 36 children. On average, they accumulated 48.6 min of MVPA
      daily and were sedentary for ~ 7 h/day. There was no statistical difference in
      these values between sexes or weekdays vs. weekends. Only 2 (5.6%) children met
      the 60-min daily MVPA recommendation compared to 42.1% of healthy children.
      Children with bronchiectasis accumulated 8229 steps/day (boys: 8422 +/- SD 473,
      girls: 8037 +/- 594), well below the recommended 12,000 steps/day. In comparison,
      daily step counts in healthy children ranged from 11,500-14,500 steps/day.
      CONCLUSION: Children with bronchiectasis are insufficiently active for health
      benefit and would substantially benefit from programs to promote PA and reduce
      sedentary behavior.

TI  - Socioeconomic position, race/ethnicity, and inflammation in the multi-ethnic
      study of atherosclerosis.
PG  - 2383-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic position is known to be associated with
      cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis. Reasons for these associations remain 
      a topic of research. Inflammation could be an important mediating mechanism
      linking socioeconomic position to cardiovascular risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: This 
      cross-sectional study used data from the baseline examination of the Multi-Ethnic
      Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a study of 6814 men and women 45 to 84 years of 
      age. Race- and ethnicity-stratified regression analyses were used to estimate
      associations of household income and education with C-reactive protein and
      interleukin-6 before and after adjustment for infection and medication use,
      psychosocial factors, behaviors, adiposity, and diabetes mellitus. Low income was
      associated with higher concentrations of interleukin-6 in all race/ethnic groups.
      Percent differences associated with 1-SD-lower income were 9% (95% confidence
      interval [CI], 7 to 11), 6% (95% CI, 1 to 10), 8% (95% CI, 4 to 11), and 8% (95% 
      CI, 3 to 13) for whites, Chinese, blacks, and Hispanics. Low levels of education 
      were associated with higher levels of interleukin-6 only among whites and blacks 
      (percent difference in interleukin-6 associated with 1-SD-lower education: 9%
      [95% CI, 6 to 12] among Whites, and 7% [95% CI, 3 to 10] among blacks). Similar
      patterns were observed for C-reactive protein. Adiposity was the single most
      important factor explaining socioeconomic position associations, especially among
      blacks and whites. A smaller effect was seen for psychosocial factors and
      behaviors in all race groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both household income and education
      are associated with inflammation, but associations vary across race/ethnic
      groups. Associations likely result from socioeconomic position patterning of
      adiposity and other factors.

TI  - Liquid-Phase Exfoliation of Phosphorene: Design Rules from Molecular Dynamics
      Simulations.
PG  - 8255-68
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.5b02683 [doi]
AB  - The liquid-phase exfoliation of phosphorene, the two-dimensional derivative of
      black phosphorus, in the solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide
      (DMF), isopropyl alcohol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone 
      is investigated using three molecular-scale "computer experiments". We modeled
      solvent-phosphorene interactions using an atomistic force field, based on ab
      initio calculations and lattice dynamics, that accurately reproduces experimental
      mechanical properties. We probed solvent molecule ordering at phosphorene/solvent
      interfaces and discovered that planar molecules such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
      preferentially orient parallel to the interface. We subsequently measured the
      energy required to peel a single phosphorene monolayer from a stack of black
      phosphorus and analyzed the role of "wedges" of solvent molecules intercalating
      between phosphorene sheets in initiating exfoliation. The exfoliation efficacy of
      a solvent is enhanced when either molecular planarity "sharpens" this molecular
      wedge or strong phosphorene-solvent adhesion stabilizes the newly exposed
      phosphorene surfaces. Finally, we examined the colloidal stability of exfoliated 
      flakes by simulating their aggregation and showed that dispersion is favored when
      the cohesive energy between the molecules in the solvent monolayer confined
      between the phosphorene sheets is high (as with DMSO) and is hindered when the
      adhesion between these molecules and phosphorene is strong; the molecular
      planarity in solvents like DMF enhances the cohesive energy. Our results are
      consistent with, and provide a molecular context for, experimental exfoliation
      studies of phosphorene and other layered solids, and our molecular insights into 
      the significant role of solvent molecular geometry and ordering should complement
      prevalent solubility-parameter-based approaches in establishing design rules for 
      effective nanomaterial exfoliation media.

TI  - Role of SIRT3 in Angiotensin II-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells
      dysfunction.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1186/s12872-015-0075-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SIRT3, a member of the sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent
      deacetylases, resides primarily in the mitochondria and has been shown to
      deacetylate several metabolic and respiratory enzymes that regulate important
      mitochondrial functions. Previous researches show an important role of SIRT3 in
      regulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and highlight the
      ability of SIRT3 to protect cells from oxidative damage. A key substance of
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), Angiotensin II (AngII) can induce
      cells dysfunction by increasing the production of ROS. In this paper, we focus on
      the role of SIRT3 in AngII-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells
      (HUVECs) dysfunction. METHODS: To study the influence of AngII on SIRT3
      expression, HUVECs were treated with AngII of 10(-7), 10(-6), 10(-5) mol/L for 24
      h. SIRT3 expression was detected by wester-blotting analysis and RT-PCR. In
      addition, to research the role of SIRT3 in AngII-induced HUVECs,we used SIRT3
      siRNA to knock down SIRT3 expression in HUVECs. Cells pretreated with negative
      control siRNA or SIRT3 siRNA were exposed to AngII for 24 h, and endothelial
      nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, eNOS activity, total level of nitric
      oxide (NO) and ROS generation of each group were detected. RESULTS: Here we show 
      that AngII treatment could increase generation of ROS, and decrease eNOS activity
      and total level of NO, while upregulated eNOS expression as a compensatory
      mechanism. The stimulation of AngII upregulated the expression of SIRT3 in
      HUVECs. SIRT3 siRNA worsen the AngII-induced effects above, besides,
      downregulated eNOS protein expression. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SIRT3 
      plays a role of protection in AngII-induced HUVECs dysfunction via regulation of 
      ROS generation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a multicomponent
      intervention combining physical, cognitive, and social activities developed to
      promote community activity in improving cognitive function in older adults with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Single-blind randomized controlled
      trial. SETTING: A total of 83 Japanese older adults with MCI participated in the 
      study from April to September 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly
      assigned to either the multicomponent intervention group (n = 41), attending
      90-minute physical, cognitive, or social activity sessions using community
      resources twice weekly, or the health education control group (n = 42). OUTCOMES:
      The primary outcomes were cognitive functions, and the secondary outcomes were
      grip strength, walking speed, depressive symptoms, physical activities, number of
      outdoor activities, and conversation time. RESULTS: Analysis using linear mixed
      models revealed significantly greater improvements in the intervention group in
      spatial working memory (p = 0.024) following intervention compared with the
      control group. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (p = 0.048)
      and step count (p = 0.059) decreased from the baseline post-intervention in the
      control group, whereas the baseline was maintained in the intervention group. No 
      significant between-group differences were found post-intervention in the other
      primary and secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a 24-week
      multicomponent intervention program was effective in improving spatial working
      memory and maintaining physical activity in older adults with MCI. A follow-up
      investigation is required to determine whether continuation of physical,
      cognitive, and social activity can prevent dementia or reverse MCI in older
      adults.

PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1159/000093441 [doi]
AB  - The peritoneal dialysis system has three major components: the peritoneal
      microcirculation, the peritoneal membrane, and the dialysate compartment. All
      these three that includes the composition of the solution and the modalities of
      delivery. All these three components may have an important impact on the final
      performance of the technique. As in the hemodialysis system, factors affecting
      diffusion of solutes as well as factors affecting convective transport may
      contribute to the final clearance of a given solute. Ultrafiltration responds to 
      the same pressures applied to the extracorporeal dialysis system, but osmotic
      gradients represent by far the most important active component.

TI  - Fabrication of electrically bistable organic semiconducting/ferroelectric blend
      films by temperature controlled spin coating.
PG  - 6325-30
LID - 10.1021/acsami.5b00705 [doi]
AB  - Organic semiconducting/ferroelectric blend films attracted much attention due to 
      their electrical bistability and rectification properties and thereof the
      potential in resistive memory devices. During film deposition from the blend
      solution, spinodal decomposition induced phase separation, resulting in discrete 
      semiconducting phase whose electrical property could be modulated by the
      continuous ferroelectric phase. However, blend films processed by common spin
      coating method showed extremely rough surfaces, even comparable to the film
      thickness, which caused large electrical leakage and thus compromised the
      resistive switching performance. To improve film roughness and thus increase the 
      productivity of these resistive devices, we developed temperature controlled spin
      coating technique to carefully adjust the phase separation process. Here we
      reported our experimental results from the blend films of ferroelectric
      poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) and semiconducting
      poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). We conducted a series of experiments at various
      deposition temperatures ranging from 20 to 90 degrees C. The resulting films were
      characterized by AFM, SEM, and VPFM to determine their structure and roughness.
      Film roughness first decreased and then increased with the increase of deposition
      temperature. Electrical performance was also characterized and obviously improved
      insulating property was obtained from the films deposited between 50 and 70
      degrees C. By temperature control during film deposition, it is convenient to
      efficiently fabricate ferroelectric/semiconducting blend films with good
      electrical bistability.

TI  - Effect of water-soluble silicon supplementation on bone status and balance of
      calcium and magnesium in male mice.

AB  - Silicon (Si) is important for the growth and development of bone and connective
      tissues. Several studies have reported that Si supplementation improved bone
      mineral density (BMD) in female ovarectomized rats. However, few studies have
      investigated the effects of Si supplementation on bone status and bone metabolism
      in male animals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Si
      supplementation on BMD and balance of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in adult
      male mice. Si was administrated orally through demineralized water containing
      different contents of Si as a form of sodium metasilicate (0 %, control; 0.025 %,
      Si50; 0.050 %, Si100; and 0.075 %, Si150) to 9-week-old male mice for 4 weeks. Si
      supplementation did not alter weight gain or BMD of femur and tibia in male mice.
      However, a high level of Si (0.05 and 0.075 %) supplementation significantly
      decreased Mg retention without changing Ca retention. Serum alkaline phosphatase 
      of Si-supplemented groups significantly decreased compared with that of the
      control. According to these results, short-term Si supplementation did not affect
      BMD but showed a possible effect on increasing the need for Mg in adult male
      mice.

AB  - Natural plant products have been widely used in controlling cancer with fewer or 
      no side effects and the use of plant extracts as complementary to synthetic
      medicine is gaining increased popularity. Members of Andrographis plants possess 
      important medicinal properties. In the present study, anti-cancerous properties
      of Andrographis nallamalayana (AN) were tested on A375 and B16F10 skin melanoma
      cancer cell lines. The leaf extracts of AN significantly reduced the cell
      viability and cell survival of skin cancer cell lines, achieved by MTT assay and 
      clonogenic assays, respectively. Further, TUNEL assays revealed that AN extracts 
      induces the apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that AN leaf extracts
      reduced the expression of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein and induced the
      expression of proapoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 associated death promoter
      protein (BAD), Bcl-2 associated X protein (BAX) and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, 
      the qRT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated the reduced expression of G2/M
      phase proteins cdk1, cyclin B1 and increased expression of p53, cyclin-dependent 
      kinase 1 inhibitor, p21. Further, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that AN
      reduced the NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, luciferase reporter assays
      demonstrated reporter gene activation. qRT-PCR assays showed that AN
      significantly reduced the expression of NF-kappaB target genes. The results
      concluded that the extracts of AN exhibited significant anti-proliferative,
      anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic activities on melanoma skin cancer cell
      lines.

AB  - Choniomyzon inflatus Wakabayashi, Otake, Tanaka & Nagasawa, 2013 (Copepoda:
      Siphonostomatoida: Nicothoidae), an associate of the scyllarid lobster Ibacus
      novemdentatus Gibbes, was found to pass through at least four developmental
      stages: nauplius, copepodid I (CI), copepodid II or later (CII+) and adult.
      Free-living nauplii were observed hatching from the ovisacs of adult females. CI 
      was found on the body surface of both female and male hosts, whereas CII+ and
      adult were obtained from the female host's egg masses. The life-cycle of this
      copepod is presumed to be as follows: (i) nauplius develops into CI in the water 
      column; (ii) infective CI settles on body surface of host; (iii) CI moults into
      the following stage, changing its microhabitat from host's body surface to egg
      masses; (iv) CII+ develops on egg masses of host until adult stage; and (v) adult
      female and male mate on the host's egg masses.

      Study.
PG  - 2171865
LID - 10.1155/2017/2171865 [doi]
AB  - Purpose. To understand older adults' engagement in their recovery experience and 
      rehabilitation after a fall-related hip fracture. Method. 50 community-dwelling
      older adults recovering from a recent (3-12 months) hip fracture (32 women, 18
      men) participated in telephone interviews using a semistructured format at 6 and 
      12 months after recruitment into the study. Interviews were conducted as part of 
      a mixed-methods study designed to test the effect of a postoperative hip fracture
      management program (B4 Clinic). Results. Three substantive themes were identified
      in the qualitative data: (1) managing expectations; (2) engaging in physical
      activity; and (3) there is life after fracture. Participants shared valuable
      insight into how their expectations for their recovery period compared to their
      lived experience and the role of physical activity in their ability to return to 
      their prefracture activities. Conclusions. Our findings reflect older adults'
      expectations for recovery from hip fracture. Encouraging engagement in
      rehabilitative exercises and addressing expectations prior to hospital discharge 
      may improve patients' adherence to rehabilitation programs, functional outcomes, 
      and postoperative quality of life. Implications for rehabilitation include the
      necessity for early and ongoing engagement of rehabilitation professionals.

TI  - Evaluations of Actiheart, IDEEA(R) and RT3 monitors for estimating activity
      energy expenditure in free-living women.
PG  - e31
LID - 10.1017/jns.2013.18 [doi]
AB  - Activity energy expenditure (AEE) during free-living conditions can be assessed
      using devices based on different principles. To make proper comparisons of
      different devices' capacities to assess AEE, they should be evaluated in the same
      population. Thus, in the present study we evaluated, in the same group of
      subjects, the ability of three devices to assess AEE in groups and individuals
      during free-living conditions. In twenty women, AEE was assessed using RT3
      (three-axial accelerometry) (AEERT3), Actiheart (a combination of heart rate and 
      accelerometry) (AEEActi) and IDEEA (a multi-accelerometer system) (AEEIDEEA).
      Reference AEE (AEEref) was assessed using the doubly labelled water method and
      indirect calorimetry. Average AEEActi was 5760 kJ per 24 h and not significantly 
      different from AEEref (5020 kJ per 24 h). On average, AEERT3 and AEEIDEEA were
      2010 and 1750 kJ per 24 h lower than AEEref, respectively (P < 0.001). The limits
      of agreement (+/- 2 sd) were 2940 (Actiheart), 1820 (RT3) and 2650 (IDEEA) kJ per
      24 h. The variance for AEERT3 was lower than for AEEActi (P = 0.006). The RT3
      classified 60 % of the women in the correct activity category while the
      corresponding value for IDEEA and Actiheart was 30 %. In conclusion, the
      Actiheart may be useful for groups and the RT3 for individuals while the IDEEA
      requires further development. The results are likely to be relevant for a large
      proportion of Western women of reproductive age and demonstrate that the
      procedure selected to assess physical activity can greatly influence the
      possibilities to uncover important aspects regarding interactions between
      physical activity, diet and health.

PG  - 603-33
LID - 10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104555 [doi]
AB  - Fluctuation theorems, developed over the past 15 years, have resulted in
      fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of how irreversibility emerges
      from reversible dynamics and have provided new statistical mechanical
      relationships for free-energy changes. They describe the statistical fluctuations
      in time-averaged properties of many-particle systems such as fluids driven to
      nonequilibrium states and provide some of the few analytical expressions that
      describe nonequilibrium states. Quantitative predictions on fluctuations in small
      systems that are monitored over short periods can also be made, and therefore the
      fluctuation theorems allow thermodynamic concepts to be extended to apply to
      finite systems. For this reason, we anticipate an important role for fluctuation 
      theorems in the design of nanotechnological devices and in the understanding of
      biological processes. This review discusses these theorems, their physical
      significance, and results for experimental and model systems.

TI  - Inhibition of sterol 4alpha-methyl oxidase is the principal mechanism by which
      garlic decreases cholesterol synthesis.
PG  - 759S-764S

AB  - Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that garlic ingestion lowers blood
      cholesterol levels, and treatment of cells in culture with garlic and
      garlic-derived compounds inhibits cholesterol synthesis. To identify the
      principal site of inhibition in the cholesterolgenic pathway and the active
      components of garlic, cultured hepatoma cells were treated with aqueous garlic
      extract or its chemical derivatives, and radiolabeled cholesterol and
      intermediates were identified and quantified. Garlic extract reduced cholesterol 
      synthesis by up to 75% without evidence of cellular toxicity. Levels of squalene 
      and 2,3-oxidosqualene were not altered by garlic, indicating that the site of
      inhibition was downstream of lanosterol synthesis, and identical results were
      obtained with 14C-acetate and 14C-mevalonate, confirming that
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity was not affected in these
      short-term studies. Several methylsterols that accumulated in the presence of
      garlic were identified by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as
      4,4'-dimethylzymosterol and a possible metabolite of 4-methylzymosterol; both are
      substrates for sterol 4alpha-methyl oxidase, pointing to this enzyme as the
      principal site of inhibition in the cholesterolgenic pathway by garlic. Of 9
      garlic-derived compounds tested for their ability to inhibit cholesterol
      synthesis, only diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and allyl mercaptan proved
      inhibitory, each yielding a pattern of sterol accumulation identical with that
      obtained with garlic extract. These results indicate that compounds containing an
      allyl-disulfide or allyl-sulfhydryl group are most likely responsible for the
      inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by garlic and that this inhibition is likely 
      mediated at sterol 4alpha-methyl oxidase.

TI  - Composite pheochromocytoma: a clinicopathologic and molecular comparison with
      ordinary pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma.
PG  - 69-73
LID - 10.1309/AJCPN76VTIGWPOAG [doi]
AB  - Composite pheochromocytoma is a rare adrenal tumor composed of ordinary
      pheochromocytoma and other components, most frequently neuroblastic elements.
      Little is known about its biologic potential, therefore creating a clinical
      dilemma on diagnosis. This study investigates the clinical characteristics and
      N-myc amplification status of 4 cases of composite pheochromocytoma and compares 
      them with selected cases of ordinary pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. The age 
      range of the patients with composite pheochromocytoma was 15 to 40 years with an 
      equal M/F ratio, including 2 patients with syndromes. None of these composite
      pheochromocytomas demonstrated N-myc amplification, none recurred, and there were
      no deaths. Of the classic pheochromocytomas, none demonstrated N-myc
      amplification, 2 recurred, and there were no deaths. Of the neuroblastomas, 5
      (50%) of 10 showed significant N-myc amplification, and there were 4 known
      recurrences and 5 known deaths. These findings suggest that composite
      pheochromocytoma may be regarded as a histologic variant of classic
      pheochromocytoma.

TI  - Diversification in the tropical pacific: comparisons between marine and
      terrestrial systems and the importance of founder speciation.
PG  - 922-34
LID - 10.1093/icb/42.5.922 [doi]
AB  - Patterns of distribution and processes of differentiation have often been
      contrasted between terrestrial and marine biotas. The islands of Oceania offer an
      excellent setting to explore this contrast, because the geographic setting for
      terrestrial and shallow-water, benthic, marine organisms are the same: the myriad
      islands strewn across the vast Pacific. The size of species ranges and the
      geographic distribution of endemism are two biogeographic attributes that are
      thought to differ markedly between terrestrial and marine biotas in the Pacific. 
      While terrestrial species are frequently confined to single islands or
      archipelagoes throughout Oceania, marine species tend to have wide to very wide
      distributions, and are rarely restricted to single island groups except for the
      most isolated archipelagoes. We explore the conditions under which species can
      reach an island by dispersal and differentiate. Genetic differentiation can occur
      either through founder speciation or vicariance; these processes are requisite
      ends of a continuum. We show that founder speciation is most likely when few
      propagules enter the dispersal medium and survive well while they travel far. We 
      argue that conditions favorable to founder speciation are common in marine as
      well as terrestrial systems, and that terrestrial-type, archipelagic-level
      endemism is likely common in marine taxa. We give examples of marine groups that 
      show archipelagic level endemism on most Pacific island groups as well as of
      terrestrial species that are widespread. Thus both the patterns and processes of 
      insular diversification are variable, and overlap more between land and sea than 
      previously considered.

TI  - Dental care during orthodontic treatment with electric toothbrushes.
PG  - 337-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In an in-vitro experimental set-up, we tested the efficacy of
      different electric toothbrushes in cleaning teeth with a multibracket appliance. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The efficacy of three sonic and four rotating toothbrushes 
      were compared; the brushes removed artificial plaque from plastic teeth. The
      amount of removed plaque substitute was determined via a comparative
      photo-analysis with one picture of the teeth before and one picture after the
      brushing cycle. Two views of the tooth segment were chosen: one vestibular view
      and one apical view of the areas behind the bracket wings. All tests were carried
      out with water, elmex and Pearls and Dents as brushing media. RESULTS: The data
      showed greater brushing efficacy when Pearls and Dents toothpaste was used. The
      Sonicare toothbrush was the most efficient. The Sonicmax and rotating Oral-B
      ProfessionalCare 7000 were also very efficacious. On average, all the other
      toothbrushes performed less well. All toothbrushes were capable of brushing the
      undercut areas behind the bracket wings, with plaque removal being the greatest
      when the Sonicare toothbrush was used together with Pearls and Dents.
      CONCLUSIONS: The best electric toothbrushes did not demonstrate good tooth
      cleaning. Longer brushing times, mastery of the proper brushing technique, and/or
      special toothbrush heads are absolutely necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic injury remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity
      and mortality worldwide, with a large economic burden. One fourth of annual
      Medicare expenditures result from readmissions, including trauma. The American
      College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (ACS TQIP) has elevated
      care for >200 trauma programs worldwide. We use ACS TQIP, which does not include 
      30-day outcomes featured in the ACS NSQIP, affecting observed readmission rates. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Trauma patients were subjected to the 30-day follow-up with the ACS
      NSQIP tools to assess readmission rates. The existing standard hospital and
      trauma registry data review was used to determine readmission, with the same
      group assessed for readmission using the information collected with the modified 
      TQIP tools. All data collected via this method were patient reported and verified
      by review of records at our facility and via patient-authorized outside record
      review. RESULTS: Six hundred and ninety-eight consecutive patients were admitted 
      to the trauma service during the study period and 378 (54.1%) were contacted by
      telephone for interview. Demographic characteristics were similar (p = NS). The
      readmission rate changed from 4.01% to 2.4% using the hospital and trauma
      registry subset (p = NS). Readmission rate by the modified TQIP method was 7.1%
      (p < 0.03). Readmitted patients did not differ with respect to routine follow-up 
      visits. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized that our observed and actual readmission
      rates differed. We discovered a significant difference in reported rates.
      Incorporating an NSQIP-like postdischarge feedback process can improve the
      accuracy of hospitals' readmission data and complication reporting, and thereby
      improve the value of the information TQIP uses as benchmarks.

      health benefits, but knowledge of its effects on global gene expression in the
      colon is limited. The main objective of the current study was to identify genes
      affected by RS in the proximal colon to infer which biologic pathways were
      modulated. Ten 17-wk-old male pigs, fitted with a cannula in the proximal colon
      for repeated collection of tissue biopsy samples and luminal content, were fed a 
      digestible starch (DS) diet or a diet high in RS (34%) for 2 consecutive periods 
      of 14 d in a crossover design. Analysis of the colonic transcriptome profiles
      revealed that, upon RS feeding, oxidative metabolic pathways, such as the
      tricarboxylic acid cycle and beta-oxidation, were induced, whereas many immune
      response pathways, including adaptive and innate immune system, as well as cell
      division were suppressed. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor gamma was identified as a potential key upstream regulator. RS
      significantly (P < 0.05) increased the relative abundance of several
      butyrate-producing microbial groups, including the butyrate producers
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Megasphaera elsdenii, and reduced the abundance 
      of potentially pathogenic members of the genus Leptospira and the phylum
      Proteobacteria. Concentrations in carotid plasma of the 3 main short-chain fatty 
      acids acetate, propionate, and butyrate were significantly higher with RS
      consumption compared with DS consumption. Overall, this study provides novel
      insights on effects of RS in proximal colon and contributes to our understanding 
      of a healthy diet.

AB  - Evaluation of respiratory activity during sleep is essential in order to reliably
      diagnose sleep disorder breathing (SDB); a condition associated with serious
      cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality. In the current study, we developed and
      validated a robust automatic breathing-sounds (i.e. inspiratory and expiratory
      sounds) detection system of audio signals acquired during sleep. Random forest
      classifier was trained and tested using inspiratory/expiratory/noise events
      (episodes), acquired from 84 subjects consecutively and prospectively referred to
      SDB diagnosis in sleep laboratory and in at-home environment. More than 560,000
      events were analyzed, including a variety of recording devices and different
      environments. The system's overall accuracy rate is 88.8%, with accuracy rate of 
      91.2% and 83.6% in in-laboratory and at-home environments respectively, when
      classifying between inspiratory, expiratory, and noise classes. Here, we provide 
      evidence that breathing-sounds can be reliably detected using non-contact audio
      technology in at-home environment. The proposed approach may improve our
      understanding of respiratory activity during sleep. This in return, will improve 
      early SDB diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Wenshen Xiaozheng Tang (WXT), a traditional
      Chinese medicine prescription, exerted a good therapeutic effect on
      endometriosis. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In the present
      study, we sought to evaluate the effect of WXT on the proliferation and migration
      of ectopic endometriotic stromal cells and explore the potential molecular
      mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary stromal cells derived from ectopic
      endometriotic lesions of patients with endometriosis were isolated and cultured. 
      The inhibition effect of WXT on cell proliferation was determined by MTT.
      Apoptosis of ectopic endometriotic cells treated with WXT was analyzed with
      Annexin V-FITC/7-AAD staining. The activation of caspases was detected by western
      blot analysis. The influence of WXT on migration of ectopic endometriotic cells
      was measured by scratch wound healing assay and Transwell assay. The DNA binding 
      activity of NF-kappaB and the expression of nuclear p65 protein were determined
      by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and western blot analysis, respectively. 
      The impact of WXT on the expression of NF-kappaB regulated gene products involved
      in apoptosis and migration was determined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: WXT 
      inhibited the proliferation of ectopic endometriotic cells in a time- and
      dose-dependent manner. In addition, WXT treatment resulted in significant
      induction of apoptosis through the activation of caspases and inhibition of
      migration in ectopic endometriotic cells. WXT notably suppressed constitutive
      NF-kappaB-DNA-binding activity as well as TNF-alpha induced nuclear translocation
      of NF-kappaB p65 subunit in ectopic endometriotic cells. Moreover, WXT diminished
      the expression of NF-kappaB regulated gene products involved in apoptosis and
      migration, including c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, survivin, Mcl-1, COX-2 and MMP-9.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that WXT induces apoptosis and inhibits
      migration of ectopic endometriotic stromal cells.

AB  - The implementation of regional protocols for newborn hearing screening and early 
      audiologic diagnosis represent the first step of the entire diagnostic,
      rehabilitative and prosthetic programme for children with permanent hearing
      impairment. The maximum benefit of early diagnosis can indeed be obtained only by
      prompt rehabilitation aimed at fostering the child's communicative, linguistic
      and cognitive development. Within the framework of the CMM 2013 project of the
      Ministry of Health entitled "Preventing Communication Disorders: a Regional
      Program for Early Identification, Intervention and Care of Hearing Impaired
      Children", the problems concerning the promotion of the global development of
      children with PHI through an early rehabilitation project based on shared
      knowledge and scientific evidence. In this project, our specific aim was to
      define the features and modes of access to a precise and specialised
      rehabilitation project for the small hearing-impaired child within three months
      from audiologic diagnosis. Three main recommendations relative to assessment and 
      rehabilitation aspects of early care emerged from the study.

TI  - Thinking about nursing practice and culture: syringe drivers.
PG  - 490-3
AB  - We recently set up a new inpatient unit and this involved making various
      decisions about our philosophy and approach to nursing practice (Shaw et al,
      2007). One of the clinical issues we had to deal with was how to manage syringe
      drivers. Syringe drivers had been used within the community for many years, and
      local guidelines about their use along with various policies and procedures
      existed. We considered all of this information and asked some critical questions 
      about it. One of the most practical issues we explored was the volume (or length)
      of infusions. This single issue and our response to it caused a significant
      amount of reaction among colleagues. We have written this article in an attempt
      to explain some of the issues relating to nursing practice and culture as we
      perceive them and to raise questions about why and how professionals sometimes
      respond to changes in practice.

TI  - Insulin resistance without obesity induced by cotton pellet granuloma in mice.
PG  - 362-9
LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2008.161 [doi]
AB  - Obesity leads to insulin resistance because the larger adipocytes in obese
      persons secrete proinflammatory cytokines that cause chronic inflammation in
      adipose tissue. This, in turn, leads to the alteration of adipokine secretion,
      which can induce insulin resistance. However, the development of insulin
      resistance without obesity is still obscure. We aimed to use an animal
      inflammation model with cotton pellet granuloma (CPG) in adipose tissue to
      characterize insulin resistance formation. We found that CPG in epididymal white 
      adipose tissue (WAT), rather than in interscapular brown adipose tissue, impaired
      insulin sensitivity, and glucose utilization, and that it decreased levels of
      phosphoinsulin receptor and phospho-Akt in both muscle and liver tissue, but that
      it did not modify the body weight or food intake in mice. Macrophage infiltration
      in adipose tissue, leukocyte counts, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and
      interleukin-6 were elevated in CPG-treated mice. However, we found a marked
      decrease of plasma adiponectin only in the WAT group, which might have been
      because of the lower level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma in
      WAT. These results show that granuloma formation in WAT by implantation of a
      cotton pellet may induce insulin resistance under nonobese condition through
      circulating inflammatory mediators, especially the low level of adiponectin.

PG  - 1470-3

AB  - Trypanosoma brucei, a causative agent of African Sleeping Sickness, constantly
      changes its dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat to avoid elimination by
      the immune system of its mammalian host, using an extensive repertoire of
      dedicated genes. However, the dynamics of VSG expression in T. brucei during an
      infection are poorly understood. We have developed a method, based on de novo
      assembly of VSGs, for quantitatively examining the diversity of expressed VSGs in
      any population of trypanosomes and monitored VSG population dynamics in vivo. Our
      experiments revealed unexpected diversity within parasite populations and a
      mechanism for diversifying the genome-encoded VSG repertoire. The interaction
      between T. brucei and its host is substantially more dynamic and nuanced than
      previously expected.

TI  - Inferring cell type innovations by phylogenetic methods-concepts, methods, and
      limitations.
PG  - 653-61
LID - 10.1002/jez.b.22657 [doi]
AB  - Multicellular organisms are composed of distinct cell types that have specific
      roles in the body. Each cell type is a product of two kinds of historical
      processes-development and evolution. Although the concept of a cell type is
      difficult to define, the cell type concept based on the idea of the core
      regulatory network (CRN), a gene regulatory network that determines the identity 
      of a cell type, illustrates the essential aspects of the cell type concept. The
      first step toward elucidating cell type evolution is to reconstruct the
      evolutionary relationships of cell types, or the cell type tree. The sister cell 
      type model assumes that a new cell type evolves through divergence from a
      multifunctional ancestral cell type, creating tree-like evolutionary
      relationships between cell types. The process of generating a cell type tree can 
      also be understood as the sequential addition of a new branching point on an
      ancestral cell differentiation hierarchy in evolution. A cell type tree thus
      represents an intertwined history of cell type evolution and development. Cell
      type trees can be reconstructed from high-throughput sequencing data, and the
      reconstruction of a cell type tree leads to the discovery of genes that are
      functionally important for a cell type. Although many issues including the lack
      of cross-species comparisons and the lack of a proper model for cell type
      evolution remain, the study of the origin of a new cell type using phylogenetic
      methods offers a promising new research avenue in developmental evolution. J.

LID - 10.1089/jir.2011.0024 [doi]
AB  - To assess the protective effects of the cytokine inhibitor interleukin-1 receptor
      antagonist (IL-1ra) on gene induction, an electroporation technique to treat
      adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats was established, and its advantage was
      estimated in the present study. Electroporation with human IL-1ra was performed
      in Lewis rats before and after induction of AIA. Local inflammation was evaluated
      by monitoring hind paw swelling, whereas histological evaluations were performed 
      using paraffin embedded sections of hind paw specimens stained with hematoxylin
      and eosin. In addition, serum IL-1? levels were analyzed using an enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. Induction of IL-1ra by our electroporation method inhibited 
      systematic body weight loss and enhancement of local inflammation after
      intradermal injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Notably, IL-1ra 
      electroporation reduced paw swelling, inflammation, and bone erosion scores in
      embedded sections and serum IL-1? levels induced in AIA rats. The IL-1ra gene
      induction using the present electroporation technique inhibited local and
      systematic inflammation in AIA rats. These results indicate that this method may 
      represent a novel pharmacotherapy strategy for arthritis.

TI  - Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in eastern Turkey in 2006.
PG  - 2179-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) that had
      previously been detected throughout Asia, with major economic and health
      repercussions, extended to eastern Turkey in late December 2005 and early January
      2006. METHODS: We documented the epidemiologic, clinical, and radiologic features
      of all cases of confirmed H5N1 virus infection in patients who were admitted to
      Yuzuncu Yil University Hospital in Van, Turkey, between December 31, 2005, and
      January 10, 2006. RESULTS: H5N1 virus infection was diagnosed in eight patients. 
      The patients were 5 to 15 years of age, and all eight had a history of close
      contact with diseased or dead chickens. The mean (+/-SD) time between exposure
      and the onset of illness was 5.0+/-1.3 days. All the patients had fever, and
      seven had clinical and radiologic evidence of pneumonia at presentation; four
      patients died. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and rapid influenza
      tests were negative in all patients, and the diagnosis was made by means of a
      polymerase-chain-reaction assay. CONCLUSIONS: H5N1, which causes a spectrum of
      illnesses in humans, including severe and fatal respiratory disease, can be
      difficult to diagnose.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most industrialized countries have introduced some form of universal
      newborn hearing screening program. Both identification and rehabilitation of
      hearing loss in newborns have evolved to an acceptable standard and the need for 
      a standardized etiological protocol is emerging. METHODS: Extensive literature
      search to determine which investigations can help identifying the cause of
      congenital hearing loss and how to limit extensive testing in these children by
      taking into account the most prevalent causes. FINDINGS: A stepwise approach to
      detect the cause of hearing loss in children with congenital sensorineural
      hearing loss was developed. CONCLUSION: In general it is advised to first rule
      out Cx26/Cx30 and infectious causes (cytomegalovirus and, if indicated,
      toxoplasmosis and rubella), and to preserve more extensive investigations for
      those children in whom these causes do not explain the hearing loss.

TI  - Dewatering and low-temperature pyrolysis of oily sludge in the presence of
      various agricultural biomasses.

AB  - Pyrolysis is potentially an effective treatment of waste oil residues for
      recovery of petroleum hydrocarbons, and the addition of biomass is expected to
      improve its dewatering and pyrolysis behavior. In this study, the dewatering and 
      low-temperature co-pyrolysis of oil-containing sludge in the presence of various 
      agricultural biomasses, such as rice husk, walnut shell, sawdust, and apricot
      shell, were explored. As a result, the water content gradually decreases with the
      increase of biomass addition within 0-1.0 wt % in original oily sludge.
      Comparatively, the dewatering efficiency of sludge in the presence of four types 
      of biomasses follows the order of apricot shell > walnut shell > rice husk >
      sawdust. On the other hand, rice husk and sawdust are relatively more efficient
      in the recovery of petroleum hydrocarbons compared with walnut shell and apricot 
      shell. The recovery efficiency generally increased with the increase in the
      biomass content in the range of 0-0.2 wt %, then exhibited a gradually decreasing
      trend with the increase in the biomass content from 0.2 to 1.0 wt %. The results 
      suggest that optimum amount of biomass plays an important role in the recovery
      efficiency. In addition, the addition of biomass (such as rice husk) also
      promotes the formation of CxHy and CO, increasing the calorific value of
      pyrolysis residue, and controlled the pollution components of the exhaust gas
      discharged from residue incineration. The present work implies that biomass as
      addictive holds great potential in the industrial dewatering and pyrolysis of
      oil-containing sludge.

TI  - Catalysis and the nature of mixed-metal oxides at the nanometer level: special
      properties of MO(x)/TiO(2)(110) {M= V, W, Ce} surfaces.
PG  - 9557-65
LID - 10.1039/c003665j [doi]
AB  - To rationalize structure-reactivity relationships for mixed-metal oxide
      catalysts, well-defined systems are required. Studies involving the deposition of
      nanoparticles and clusters of VO(x), CeO(x) and WO(x) on TiO(2)(110) and other
      well-defined oxide surfaces have shown novel structures that have special
      chemical properties. Dimers of vanadia and ceria have been found on TiO(2)(110), 
      monomers of vanadia on CeO(2)(111), and (WO(3))(3) clusters on TiO(2)(110). The
      V[double bond, length as m-dash]O or W[double bond, length as m-dash]O groups
      present in VO(x)/TiO(2)(110), VO(x)/CeO(2)(111) and WO(x)/TiO(2)(110) surfaces
      dislay a very high activity for the selective oxidation of alkanes and the
      dehydrogenation of alcohols. The non-typical coordination modes imposed by
      TiO(2)(110) on ceria nanoparticles make possible the direct participation of this
      oxide in catalytic reactions and enhance the dispersion of metals on the titania 
      substrate. Au/CeO(x)/TiO(2)(110) surfaces display an extremely high catalytic
      activity for CO oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction. In general, the
      chemical behavior of the MO(x)/TiO(2)(110) {M = V, Ce or W} surfaces reflects
      their unique structure at the nanometer level. These simple models can provide a 
      conceptual framework for modifying or controlling the chemical properties of
      mixed-metal oxides and for engineering industrial catalysts.

TI  - 'Diabetes' as described by Byzantine writers from the fourth to the ninth century
      AD: the Graeco-Roman influence.
PG  - 892-6
LID - 10.1007/s00125-008-0981-4 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes was first extensively described by Aretaeus of Cappadocia, and his
      contemporary, Galen of Pergamum, in the second century AD. Aretaeus is said to
      have introduced the term diabetes, though there are some indications of previous 
      references to the term. When referring to the disease, Galen accepts that the
      term belongs to 'other writers'. There are, in fact, many other Graeco-Roman
      accounts of diabetes, and in this paper we also examine the texts of Pliny the
      Elder (first century AD), Rufus of Ephesos (early second century AD), Oribasius
      (fourth century AD), Stephanus Alexandrinus (fifth century AD), Aetius (sixth
      century AD), Alexander of Tralles (sixth century AD), and Theophilus
      Protospatharius (seventh century AD ), together with his contemporaries Paulus of
      Aegina, Stephanus of Athens and Leon of Pella (ninth century AD). All these
      writers use almost the same terminology when referring to the disease, and
      consider that symptoms of excessive thirst and urination are due to disease of
      the kidneys and the bladder. Similar treatments are also advocated, and relate to
      nutritional advice, herbal medications, poultices, bloodletting and abstinence
      from diuretic substances. Although there are no notable differences between the
      writings of Byzantine physicians and the earlier descriptions attributed to
      Aretaeus and Galen, this literature testifies to the fact that these physicians
      were well aware of a disease that Galen considered rare.

TI  - Artemin promotes oncogenicity, metastasis and drug resistance in cancer cells.
PG  - 93-98

LID - /j/revneuro.2018.29.issue-1/revneuro-2017-0029/revneuro-2017-0029.xml [pii]
AB  - Artemin (ARTN) is a member of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) 
      family of ligands, and its signaling is mediated via a multi-component receptor
      complex including the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored GDNF family receptors
      a (GFRa1, GFRa3) and RET receptor tyrosine kinase. The major mechanism of ARTN
      action is via binding to a non-signaling co-receptor. The major function of ARTN 
      is to drive the molecule to induce migration and axonal projection from
      sympathetic neurons. It also promotes the survival, proliferation and neurite
      outgrowth of sympathetic neurons in vitro. ARTN triggers oncogenicity and
      metastasis by the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Recent studies have
      reported that the expression of ARTN in hepatocellular carcinoma is associated
      with increased tumor size, quick relapse and shorter survival. Furthermore, ARTN 
      promotes drug resistance such as antiestrogens, doxorubicin, fulvestrant,
      paclitaxel, tamoxifen and trastuzumab. Moreover, ARTN also stimulates the
      radio-therapeutic resistance. This review highlights the proposed roles of ARTN
      in cancer cells and discusses recent results supporting its emerging role as an
      oncogenic, metastatic and drug-resisting agent with a special focus on how these 
      new insights may facilitate rational development of ARTN for targeted therapies
      in the future.

PG  - 2080-105
LID - 10.3390/cancers3022080 [doi]
AB  - Despite the large amount of data in cancer biology and many studies into the
      likely survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, knowledge regarding the
      issue of CRC prognostic biomarkers remains poor. The Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) 
      staging system continues to be the most powerful and reliable predictor of the
      clinical outcome of CRC patients. The exponential increase of knowledge in the
      field of molecular genetics has lead to the identification of specific
      alterations involved in the malignant progression. Many of these genetic
      alterations were proposed as biomarkers which could be used in clinical practice 
      to estimate CRC prognosis. Recently there has been an explosive increase in the
      number of putative biomarkers able to predict the response to specific adjuvant
      treatment. In this review we explore and summarize data concerning prognostic and
      predictive biomarkers and we attempt to shed light on recent research that could 
      lead to the emergence of new biomarkers in CRC.

AB  - Introduction. In India, 4,86,173 HIV infected patients are on first line
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) as of January 2012. HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is
      drug and regimen-specific and should be balanced against the benefits of
      providing a given ART regimen. Material & Methods. The emergence of HIVDR
      mutations in a cohort of 100 consecutive HIV-1 infected individuals attending ART
      centre, on first line ART for 12 months, was studied. CD4(+) T-cell counts and
      plasma HIV-1 RNA level were determined. Result. Out of the 100 HIV-1 infected
      individuals, 81 showed HIVDR prevention (HIV-1 RNA level < 1000/mL), while the
      remaining 19 had HIV-1 viral RNA level > 1000/mL. HIVDR genotyping was carried
      out for individuals with evidence of virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA level >
      1000/mL). The most frequent NRTI-associated mutation observed was M184V, while
      K103N/S was the commonest mutation at NNRTI resistance position. Conclusion. Our 
      study has revealed the emergence of HIVDR in HIV-1 infected patients at the end
      of 12 months of first line ART initiation. For NRTIs, the prevalence of HIVDR
      mutations was 9% and 10% for NNRTIs. Our findings will contribute information in 
      evidence-based decision making with reference to first and second line ART
      delivery and prevention of HIVDR emergence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Residential mobility is common in families with young children;
      however, its impact on the social development of children is unclear. We examined
      associations between the number, timing and type of house moves in childhood and 
      child behaviour problems using data from an ongoing longitudinal study. METHODS: 
      Complete data on residential mobility and child behaviour was available for 403
      families. Three aspects of mobility were considered: (a) number of house moves
      from birth to <2 years, 2 to <5 years and 5 to 9 years; (b) lifetime number of
      house moves; and (c) moves associated with different housing trajectories
      characterized by changes in housing tenure. The primary outcomes were
      internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems at 9 years derived from
      Achenbach's Child Behaviour Checklist. Linear regression analyses were used to
      investigate the effect of the housing variables on internalizing and
      externalizing behaviour problem scores with adjustment for a range of
      sociodemographic and household covariates. RESULTS: Moving house >/=2 times
      before 2 years of age was associated with an increased internalizing behaviour
      score at age 9 years. This association remained after adjustment for
      sociodemographic and household factors. There was no association between
      increased residential mobility in other time periods and internalizing behaviour,
      or mobility in any period and externalizing behaviour. There was no effect of
      lifetime number of moves, or of an upwardly or downwardly mobile housing
      trajectory. However, a housing trajectory characterized by continuous rental
      occupancy was associated with an increased externalizing behaviour score.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings may suggest that there is a sensitive period, in the 
      first few years of life, in which exposure to increased residential mobility has 
      a detrimental effect on mental health in later childhood.

TI  - The effects of leptin in combination with a cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist, AM
      251, or cannabidiol on food intake and body weight in rats fed a high-fat or a
      free-choice high sugar diet.
PG  - 487-96
AB  - High intake of fats and sugars has prompted a rapid growth in the number of obese
      individuals worldwide. To further investigate whether simultaneous
      pharmacological intervention in the leptin and cannabinoid system might change
      food and water intake, preferences for palatable foods, and body weight, we have 
      examined the effects of concomitant intraperitoneal administration of leptin and 
      AM 251, a cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist, or cannabidiol (CBD), a plant 
      cannabinoid, in rats maintained on either a high-fat (HF) diet (45% energy from
      fat) or free-choice (FC) diet consisting of high-sucrose and normal rat chow (83%
      and 61% energy from carbohydrates, respectively). Leptin at a dose of 100 mug/kg 
      injected individually for 3 subsequent days to rats fed a HF diet reduced
      significantly the daily caloric intake and inhibited body weight gain. The
      hormone had no significant effects, however, on either caloric intake, body
      weight or food preferences in rats fed an FC diet. Co-injection of leptin and 1
      mg/kg AM 251 resulted in a further significant decrease in HF diet intake and a
      profound reduction in body weight gain both in HF diet- and FC diet-fed rats.
      This drug combination, however, had no effect on the consumption of high-sucrose 
      chow. In contrast, 3mg/kg of CBD co-injected with leptin did not modify leptin
      effects on food intake in rats maintained on an FC or HF diet. None of the drug
      combinations affected water consumption. It is concluded that the concomitant
      treatment with leptin and AM 251 attenuated markedly body weight gain in rats
      maintained on high-calorie diets rich in fat and carbohydrates but did not affect
      preferences for sweet food.

TI  - Isotropic magnetic exchange between anisotropic Yb(III) ions. Study of Cs3Yb2Cl9 
      and Cs3Yb2Br9 crystals.
PG  - 3984-92
AB  - Despite the prevalent belief about a strong anisotropy of the magnetic exchange
      in rare-earth compounds, Cs3Yb2Cl9 and Cs3Yb2Br9 crystals are found to exhibit
      fully isotropic exchange coupling between Yb3+ ions. In this article, we attempt 
      to reveal the physical origin of this surprising feature. Our theoretical
      consideration is based on a model of the kinetic exchange between two
      octahedrally coordinated Yb3+ ions in their ground Kramers doublet states. It is 
      shown that a mechanism of kinetic exchange involving intercenter electron hopping
      between 4f orbitals of two Yb3+ ions in a face-shared binuclear unit results in
      fully isotropic antiferromagnetic exchange coupling, while a mechanism in which
      the electron jumps from the 4f to the 5d orbital gives rise to a highly
      anisotropic interaction. Comparison of these results with the experimental data
      along with qualitative arguments regarding the relative significance of these two
      contributions to the overall exchange indicate that, in face-shared Yb3+
      binuclear units, the 4f <--> 4f mechanism plays a dominant role.

AB  - This report describes how donor- and recipient-derived immunity was influenced by
      immunosuppressive treatment of ABO incompatibility (rituximab and
      immunoadsorption/plasmaphereses) in the long-term. We present an 8-year course of
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunity, isohemagglutinins and B cell numbers. Whereas
      cellular HBV immunity was transferred from the HBV vaccinated donor (blood group 
      A1) to the HBV naive recipient (blood group 0), humoral HBV specific immune
      transfer was lacking. Starting at month 17 after transplantation, the recipient
      was vaccinated six times against HBV. Anti-HBs did not appear until the sixth
      vaccination at month 44. Immunoadsorption prior to transplantation reduced
      anti-A1 IgG titers from 256 to 2. Titers after transplantation remained low (64).
      B cell numbers were below standard values up to month 26, then normalized and
      exceeded normal values from year 7 to 8 post transplantation. In conclusion,
      donor-derived B cell immunity was lost but recipient-derived immunity persisted
      after ABO incompatible transplantation.

      therapy.
PG  - 291-308
AB  - PURPOSE: Adverse effects are important determinants of quality of life (QOL)
      during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The PLATO study investigated
      the association between changes in patient-reported outcomes including QOL and
      substitution with lopinavir/ritonavir in patients experiencing side effects
      (SEs). METHOD: HIV-1-infected participants (N = 849) with undetectable viral load
      experiencing Grade-2 SEs of the protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse 
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) component of their HAART regimen were randomized 
      to immediate (baseline) or deferred (week 4) substitution with
      lopinavir/ritonavir soft-gel capsules 400/100 mg bid. The primary endpoint was
      change in the total score from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Symptoms
      Distress Module (ASDM), supplemented with two items for nephrolithiasis.
      Secondary endpoints included Medical Outcomes Study (MOS)-HIV scores and Center
      for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scores. RESULTS: Immediate
      substitution resulted in improved ASDM total score at week 4 compared with
      deferred substitution (p <.001) and significant improvements in all MOS-HIV
      domains, while significant improvement was observed in CES-D scores at week 8.
      Primary SEs resolved at week 8 in 65% of participants in the immediate
      substitution group. Suppression of HIV-1 was maintained. Treatment was
      well-tolerated and associated with elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides.
      CONCLUSION: Substitution with LPV/r improved patient-reported outcomes including 
      QOL in patients experiencing Grade-2 SEs, while maintaining viral suppression.

AB  - Microfabricated interdigitated electrode chips have been designed for use in a
      unique gold-nanoparticle based biosensor system. The use of these electrodes will
      allow for simple, accurate, inexpensive, and portable biosensing, with potential 
      applications in diagnostics, medical research, and environmental testing. To
      determine the optimal design for these electrodes, finite element analysis
      simulations were carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The results of
      these simulations determined some of the optimal design parameters for
      microfabricating interdigitated electrodes as well as predicting the effects of
      different electrode materials. Finally, based on the results of these simulations
      two different kinds of interdigitated electrode chips were made using
      photolithography.

PG  - 3715-9
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.07.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opportunistic virus infection is one of the most common complications
      in renal transplant (RT) recipients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus (BKV) are
      important pathogens and each of these infections affects the other. In contrast, 
      there is only limited information on JC virus (JCV) infection and its relation to
      CMV infection in RT recipients. This prospective study investigated the rates of 
      JCV and CMV infections and their risk factors and correlations. METHODS: We
      studied 52 RT recipients. JCV and CMV were detected using nested qualitative
      polymerase chain reaction assays of urine. The clinical characteristics of JCV
      and CMV infection were compared and risk factors analyzed with the use of binary 
      logistic regression. RESULTS: JCV and CMV were detected in 40.4% and 34.6% of the
      RT recipients, respectively. Cyclosporine (CsA) was a risk factor for both JCV
      and CMV infection (odds ratio [OR] 7.187; P=.002; OR 4.182; P=.021); CMV
      infection was a risk factor for JCV infection (OR 3.900; P=.039). CONCLUSIONS:
      JCV and CMV infections are common in RT recipients. CsA is a risk factor for both
      JCV and CMV infection. JCV infection is related to CMV infection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A 26-year-old female presented with 4-years duration of
      asymptomatic spots on her left leg. She was otherwise healthy. On examination
      several purpuric patches up to 3 cm. in diameter were found on the flexure aspect
      of her left leg. Histological examination revealed lymphocytic infiltrate, with
      mild atypia, with red blood cell extravasation and hemosiderin deposition in the 
      papillary dermis. The clinical and histological findings were compatible with the
      diagnosis of early stage purpuric mycosis fungoides (MF). Purpuric form of MF is 
      a rare form of the disease. Physician should distinguish this disease from benign
      forms of pigmented purpuric dermatoses.

TI  - Testosterone inhibits adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells: nuclear
      translocation of androgen receptor complex with beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 
      may bypass canonical Wnt signaling to down-regulate adipogenic transcription
      factors.
PG  - 141-54
AB  - Testosterone supplementation in men decreases fat mass; however, the mechanisms
      by which it inhibits fat mass are unknown. We hypothesized that testosterone
      inhibits adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes by activation of androgen
      receptor (AR)/beta-catenin interaction and subsequent translocation of this
      complex to the nucleus thereby bypassing canonical Wnt signaling. We tested this 
      hypothesis in 3T3-L1 cells that differentiate to form fat cells in adipogenic
      medium. We found that these cells express AR and that testosterone and
      dihydrotestosterone dose-dependently inhibited adipogenic differentiation as
      analyzed by Oil Red O staining and down-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding
      protein-alpha and -delta and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2
      protein and mRNA. These inhibitory effects of androgens were partially blocked by
      flutamide or bicalutamide. Androgen treatment was associated with nuclear
      translocation of beta-catenin and AR. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated
      association of beta-catenin with AR and T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) in the presence of
      androgens. Transfection of TCF4 cDNA inhibited adipogenic differentiation,
      whereas a dominant negative TCF4 cDNA construct induced adipogenesis and blocked 
      testosterone's inhibitory effects. Our gene array analysis indicates that
      testosterone treatment led to activation of some Wnt target genes. Expression of 
      constitutively activated AR fused with VP-16 did not inhibit the expression of
      CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha in the absence of androgens. Testosterone
      and dihydrotestosterone inhibit adipocyte differentiation in vitro through an
      AR-mediated nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and activation of downstream
      Wnt signaling. These data provide evidence for a regulatory role for androgens in
      inhibiting adipogenic differentiation and a mechanistic explanation consistent
      with the observed reduction in fat mass in men treated with androgens.

TI  - Age-structured dynamic, stochastic and mechanistic simulation model of Salmonella
      Dublin infection within dairy herds.
PG  - 59-74
LID - 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.02.005 [doi]
AB  - In the demand for a decision support tool to guide farmers wanting to control
      Salmonella Dublin (S. Dublin) in Danish dairy herds, we developed an
      age-structured stochastic, mechanistic and dynamic simulation model of S. Dublin 
      in dairy herds, which incorporated six age groups (neonatal, preweaned calves,
      weaned calves, growing heifers, breeding heifers and cows) and five infection
      states (susceptible, acutely infected, carrier, super shedder and resistant). The
      model simulated population and infection dynamics over a period of 10 years in
      weekly time steps as: 1) population sizes of each of the six age-groups; 2) S.
      Dublin incidence and number of animals in each infection state; and 3) S. Dublin 
      related morbidity and mortality in the acutely infected animals. The effects of
      introducing one infectious heifer on the risk of spread of S. Dublin within the
      herd and on the duration of infection were estimated through 1000 simulation
      iterations for 48 scenarios. The scenarios covered all combinations of three herd
      sizes (70, 200 and 400 cows), four hygiene levels indicating infectious contact
      parameters, and four herd susceptibility levels indicating different
      susceptibility parameters for the individual animals in each of the six age
      groups in the herd. The hygiene level was highly influential on the probability
      that the infection spread within the herd, duration of infection and epidemic
      size. The herd susceptibility level was also influential, but not likely to
      provide sufficient prevention and control of infection on its own. Herd size did 
      not affect the probability of infection spread upon exposure, but the larger the 
      herd the more important were management and housing practices that improve
      hygiene and reduce susceptibility to shorten durations of infection in the herd
      and to increase the probability of extinction. In general, disease and mortality 
      patterns followed epidemic waves in the herds. However, an interesting pattern
      was seen for acute infections and abortions in adult cattle after the first 2
      years of infection in herds with poor hygiene and high susceptibility. Repeated
      infections in young stock lead to a high proportion of resistant adult cattle,
      which lead to a dampening effect on acute infections in adults and associated
      abortions. Sensitivity analyses of 24 alternative scenarios showed that a super
      shedder state was not essential to mimic the infection dynamics and persistence
      patterns known from field studies, but a persistent carrier state was required in
      the model to mimic real life S. Dublin infections.

TI  - Using gaze patterns to predict task intent in collaboration.
PG  - 1049
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01049 [doi]
AB  - In everyday interactions, humans naturally exhibit behavioral cues, such as gaze 
      and head movements, that signal their intentions while interpreting the
      behavioral cues of others to predict their intentions. Such intention prediction 
      enables each partner to adapt their behaviors to the intent of others, serving a 
      critical role in joint action where parties work together to achieve a common
      goal. Among behavioral cues, eye gaze is particularly important in understanding 
      a person's attention and intention. In this work, we seek to quantify how gaze
      patterns may indicate a person's intention. Our investigation was contextualized 
      in a dyadic sandwich-making scenario in which a "worker" prepared a sandwich by
      adding ingredients requested by a "customer." In this context, we investigated
      the extent to which the customers' gaze cues serve as predictors of which
      ingredients they intend to request. Predictive features were derived to represent
      characteristics of the customers' gaze patterns. We developed a support vector
      machine-based (SVM-based) model that achieved 76% accuracy in predicting the
      customers' intended requests based solely on gaze features. Moreover, the
      predictor made correct predictions approximately 1.8 s before the spoken request 
      from the customer. We further analyzed several episodes of interactions from our 
      data to develop a deeper understanding of the scenarios where our predictor
      succeeded and failed in making correct predictions. These analyses revealed
      additional gaze patterns that may be leveraged to improve intention prediction.
      This work highlights gaze cues as a significant resource for understanding human 
      intentions and informs the design of real-time recognizers of user intention for 
      intelligent systems, such as assistive robots and ubiquitous devices, that may
      enable more complex capabilities and improved user experience.

TI  - Biological activities of suilysin: role in Streptococcus suis pathogenesis.
PG  - 941-54
LID - 10.2217/fmb-2016-0028 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine and zoonotic pathogen equipped with
      several virulence factors. The pore-forming toxins are the most abundant
      bacterial toxins and classified as critical virulence (associated) factors of
      several pathogens. The role of suilysin (SLY), a pore-forming
      cholesterol-dependent cytolysin of S. suis, as a true virulence factor is under
      debate. Most of the bacterial toxins have been reported to modulate the host
      immune system to facilitate invasion and subsequent replication of bacteria
      within respective host cells. SLY has been demonstrated to play an important role
      in the pathogenesis of S. suis infection and inflammatory response in vitro and
      in vivo. This review highlights the contributions of SLY to the pathogenicity of 
      S. suis. It will address its role during the development of S. suis meningitis in
      pigs, as well as humans, and discuss SLY as a potential vaccine candidate.

TI  - Mesenchymal stem cell labeling and in vitro MR characterization at 1.5 T of new
      SPIO contrast agent: Molday ION Rhodamine-B.
PG  - 7-18
LID - 10.1002/cmmi.396 [doi]
AB  - In vivo detection of transplanted stem cells is requisite for improving stem
      cell-based treatments by developing a thorough understanding of their therapeutic
      mechanisms. MRI tracking of magnetically labeled cells is non-invasive and is
      suitable for longitudinal studies. Molday ION Rhodamine-B (MIRB) is a new
      superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) contrast agent specifically formulated for
      cell labeling and is readily internalized by non-phagocytic cells. This
      investigation characterizes mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) labeling and MR imaging
      properties of this new SPIO agent. Effects of MIRB on MSC viability and
      differentiation as well as cellular loading properties were assessed for MSC
      labeled with MIRB at concentrations from 5 to 100 microg Fe/ml. Labeled MSC were 
      evaluated, in vitro, on a clinical 1.5 T MRI. Optimal scanning sequences and
      imaging parameters were determined based on contrast-to-noise ratio and contrast 
      modulation. Relaxation rates (1/T(2)*) for gradient-echo sequences were
      approximated and an idealized limit of detection was established. MIRB labeling
      did not affect MSC viability or the ability to differentiate into either bone or 
      fat. Labeling efficiency was found to be approximately 95% for labeling
      concentrations at or above 20 microg Fe/ml. Average MIRB per MSC ranged from 0.7 
      pg Fe for labeling MIRB concentration of 5 microg Fe/ml and asymptotically
      approached a value of 20-25 pg Fe/MSC as labeling concentration increased to 100 
      microg Fe/ml. MRI analysis of MIRB MSC revealed long echo time, gradient echo
      sequences to provide the most sensitivity. Limit of detection for gradient echo
      sequences was determined to be less than 1000 MSC, with approximately 15 pg
      Fe/MSC (labeled at 20 microg Fe/ml). These investigations have laid the
      groundwork and established feasibility for the use of this contrast agent for in 
      vivo MRI detection of MSC. Properties evaluated in this study will be used as a
      reference for tracking labeled MSC for in vivo studies.

TI  - Older males, cognitive function, and alcohol consumption.
PG  - 337-53
AB  - We investigated the question, how do older men who drink alcohol differ from
      those who do not drink on measures of cognitive function, memory, affect, and
      health? Of the nonprobability sample of male participants (N = 60), 35 (58%) of
      the males reported some degree of alcohol consumption. Eleven men had one or more
      drinks per day, 14 had one or more drinks per week, and 9 were occasional
      drinkers. The drinkers reported significantly less depression, had higher
      self-reported general health and vitality, and had higher cognitive performance, 
      cognitive flexibility, and verbal memory, and greater knowledge of memory
      processes.

TI  - Use of cheese whey to enhance Geotrichum candidum biomass production in olive
      mill wastewater.
PG  - 877-82
LID - 10.1007/s10295-010-0752-3 [doi]
AB  - Geotrichum candidum is a yeast-like filamentous fungus that has attracted
      industrial interest. The present work investigated G. candidum biomass production
      in agro-industrial wastewaters (olive mill wastewater (OMW) and cheese whey (CW))
      as the only substrate. Different solid media (Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), CW, 
      OMW, and OMW/CW mixtures in different proportions) were tested. OMW/CW mixtures
      proved to be suitable for optimal mycelia growth of G. candidum with a very high 
      hyphae density. The highest fungal and expansion rate growth of 83 +/- 1 mm and
      12.4 day(-1), respectively, were obtained on a 20:80 mixture of OMW/CW, which was
      incubated for 7 days. This optimal mixture was used to study the biomass
      production and the OMW decolorization ability of G. candidum in the presence of
      CW in liquid medium. Liquid cultures were also conducted in OMW and CW
      separately. After 5 days of incubation, fungal biomass reached 9.26 g l(-1) in
      the OMW/CW mixture and only 2.83 g l(-1) in CW, while no biomass production was
      observed in OMW alone. OMW decolorization and dephenolization by G. candidum also
      improved in the presence of CW with a decolorization efficiency of 54.5% and a
      total phenolic reduction of 55.3%, compared with the control which yielded values
      of about 10% and 15%, respectively. These results suggested that OMW/CW--as the
      only substrate--could be used as a cost-effective medium to produce G. candidum
      biomass, without the need for water dilution or supplementation with other
      nutriments.

TI  - [Effective ways to improve the prognosis of advanced stage (BCLC stage C)
      hepatocellular carcinoma].
PG  - 324-7
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) or
      lymphatic/extrahepatic metastasis is classified as advanced stage (Stage C of
      Bacelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging). There is few effective therapy for the
      advanced stage HCC, leading to an extremly poor prognosis. For these patients,
      Sorafinib is recommended as the only therapy by European and American guidelines,
      which has limited clinic effect. In China, besides Sorafinib, various therapies
      have also been suggested, including surgery, trans-arterial chemoembolization
      (TACE), radiotherapy, as well as traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, it is
      reported that several therapies may be effective in treating HCC with PVTT which 
      is classified based on Cheng's classification, including surgery after
      "down-stage" radiotherapy, early use of sorafinib postoperatively, as well as
      postoperative antivirus treatment. The modified Folfox4 chemotherapy, is also a
      potential effective way to improve the prognosis of advanced stage HCC with
      lymphatic/extrahepatic metastasis. Mutiple disciplinary team which could
      faciliate the process of diagnosis and treatment of advanced stage HCC, is
      expected to favor the prognosis of these patients.

TI  - Promising high monetary rewards for future task performance increases
      intermediate task performance.
PG  - e42547
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0042547 [doi]
AB  - In everyday life contexts and work settings, monetary rewards are often
      contingent on future performance. Based on research showing that the anticipation
      of rewards causes improved task performance through enhanced task preparation,
      the present study tested the hypothesis that the promise of monetary rewards for 
      future performance would not only increase future performance, but also
      performance on an unrewarded intermediate task. Participants performed an
      auditory Simon task in which they responded to two consecutive tones. While
      participants could earn high vs. low monetary rewards for fast responses to every
      second tone, their responses to the first tone were not rewarded. Moreover, we
      compared performance under conditions in which reward information could prompt
      strategic performance adjustments (i.e., when reward information was presented
      for a relatively long duration) to conditions preventing strategic performance
      adjustments (i.e., when reward information was presented very briefly). Results
      showed that high (vs. low) rewards sped up both rewarded and intermediate,
      unrewarded responses, and the effect was independent of the duration of reward
      presentation. Moreover, long presentation led to a speed-accuracy trade-off for
      both rewarded and unrewarded tones, whereas short presentation sped up responses 
      to rewarded and unrewarded tones without this trade-off. These results suggest
      that high rewards for future performance boost intermediate performance due to
      enhanced task preparation, and they do so regardless whether people respond to
      rewards in a strategic or non-strategic manner.

PG  - 221-227

AB  - Piroplasmosis, a disease of domestic and wild animals, is caused by tick-borne
      protozoa in the genera of Theileria and Babesia. There is limited information
      available about the prevalence of piroplasmosis in ticks in China, and to assess 
      the potential threat of piroplasmosis in China, we investigated the infections of
      ovine and bovine Babesia and Theileria species in ticks collected from cattle,
      yaks, sheep, horses, and camels in several regions of China where tick-borne
      diseases have been reported. In total, 652 ticks were collected from the animals 
      in 6 provinces of China. Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. were detected with a
      PCR-RLB method and identified by sequencing. Overall, 157 ticks (24.1%) were
      infected with 5 Babesia and 4 Theileria species. Among tested tick samples, 134
      (20.6%) were single infections with 1 of 7 piroplasm species, with Theileria
      annulata (118/652, 18.1%) being dominant. Only 23 (3.5%) tick samples were double
      or triple infected, Theileria luwenshuni and Theileria sinensis (18/652, 2.8%)
      were frequently observed in co-infections. Some piroplasm species were carried by
      ticks that were not previously reported to be vectors.

      patients with malignant melanoma.
PG  - 655-65
LID - 10.1007/s00262-011-1124-1 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic targeting of melanoma antigens frequently focuses on the melanocyte
      differentiation or cancer-testis families. Antigen-loss variants can often
      result, as these antigens are not critical for tumor cell survival. Exploration
      of functionally relevant targets has been limited. The melanoma inhibitor of
      apoptosis protein (ML-IAP; livin) is overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to
      disease progression and treatment resistance. Improved understanding of the
      significance of ML-IAP immune responses in patients has possible therapeutic
      applications. We found ML-IAP frequently expressed in melanoma metastases by
      immunohistochemistry. To assess spontaneous immunity to ML-IAP, an overlapping
      peptide library representing full-length protein was utilized to screen cellular 
      responses in stage I-IV patients and healthy controls by ELISPOT. A broad array
      of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cellular responses against ML-IAP was observed with novel
      class I and class II epitopes identified. Specific HLA-A*0201 epitopes were
      analyzed further for frequency of reactivity. The generation of specific CD4(+)
      and cytotoxic T cells revealed potent functional capability including cytokine
      responsiveness to melanoma cell lines and tumor cell killing. In addition,
      recombinant ML-IAP protein used in an ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody
      responses in a subset of patients. Several melanoma patients who received CTLA-4 
      blockade with ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses to ML-IAP
      as a function of treatment which was associated with beneficial clinical
      outcomes. High frequency immune responses in melanoma patients, associations with
      favorable treatment outcomes, and its essential role in melanoma pathogenesis
      support the development of ML-IAP as a disease marker and therapeutic target.

TI  - Dacryoliths in a series of dacryocystorhinostomies: histologic and chemical
      analysis.
PG  - 657-62
AB  - PURPOSE: To present the clinical and intraoperative characteristics of dacryolith
      cases, to present their histologic and chemical analysis, and to relate the
      findings with the probable causes of their formation in a series of
      dacryocystorhinostomies performed in northern Greece. METHODS: In a series of 242
      dacryocystorhinostomies in patients with chronic dacryocystitis, dacryoliths
      large enough to perform an accurate chemical analysis and a light histologic
      examination were found in five cases. The chemical analysis was based on atomic
      absorption spectrophotometry and atomic emission spectrometry. RESULTS: These
      five cases concerned relatively young patients who presented symptoms of short
      duration as compared to the other dacryocystorhinostomy cases. In three of them, 
      irregularities of the lacrimal sac wall were observed. The final postoperative
      results were satisfactory. The histologic examination revealed acellular
      amorphous organic material and limited areas with characteristics of calcium salt
      depositions. The chemical analysis showed mainly organic and minimal inorganic
      material. CONCLUSIONS: The irregularities of the lacrimal sac wall and the
      consequent flow disorders within the sac and the histologic and chemical analysis
      of the dacryoliths provide evidence for etiologic consideration.

TI  - Synaptogenesis in the fetal corpus striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia

PG  - 60-9

AB  - Synaptogenesis can be detected in tissue sections by immunoreactivity for
      synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein that serves as a marker of
      synaptic maturation. Reactivity was prospectively studied postmortem in sections 
      of the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra in 172 normal human
      fetuses and neonates of 6 to 41 weeks' gestation. Caudate nucleus and putamen
      show patchy reactivity beginning at 13 weeks' gestation around some intracapsular
      neurons; the pattern is well developed in all regions before midgestation.
      Near-uniform reactivity throughout the striatum is achieved by 34 weeks, but
      subtle patchiness is still perceived at term. The globus pallidus shows uniform
      reactivity without stria from 13 weeks and the substantia nigra from 9 weeks.
      Synaptic patchiness in the fetal corpus striatum appears to correspond to the
      "striosomes of Graybiel" that define adjacent neurotransmitter-rich and
      neurotransmitter-poor zones. Clinical correlation is proposed with dystonic
      postures and athetoid movements observed in normal preterm neonates of 26 to 32
      weeks.

TI  - Immunohistochemical evaluation of toxic epidermal necrolysis treated with human
      intravenous immunoglobulin.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - AIM: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe drug reaction characterized by 
      massive epidermal cell death. The authors of the current study and others have
      noted improved outcomes in TEN patients treated with human intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG), purportedly due to its ability to inhibit the
      fas/fas-ligand (Fas-L) apoptotic pathway, but published case series evaluating
      TEN through the use of immunohistochemical antibody stains for Fas and Fas-L
      before and after IVIG treatment are lacking. The authors hypothesized that due to
      IVIG's ability to arrest the evolution of TEN, expression of Fas/Fas-L on
      keratinocytes would be decreased or absent following IVIG treatment. METHODS: Ten
      patients diagnosed with TEN underwent biopsies of their lesions prior to and five
      days after treatment with IVIG. Seven post-treatment biopsies were of sufficient 
      quality to undergo evaluation. RESULTS: All ten pretreatment biopsies had Fas and
      Fas-L expression by immunohistochemistry, while six out of seven (85.7%)
      post-treatment biopsies failed to demonstrate Fas or Fas-L expression. One of
      seven post-treatment biopsies stained positive for Fas and Fas-L. CONCLUSION:
      This reduced immunohistochemical expression of apoptotic markers may represent
      IVIG inhibition of the pathogenic mechanism of TEN. Alternatively reduced Fas and
      Fas-L may be a feature of reepithelialization in TEN, or characteristic of
      rapidly proliferating epidermis.

TI  - Diagnosis of HPV driven oropharyngeal cancers: Comparing p16 based algorithms
      with the RNAscope HPV-test.

LID - S1368-8375(16)30186-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2016.10.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is a
      major issue and none of the current diagnostic approaches is ideal. An in situ
      hybridization (ISH) assay that detects high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA, called the
      RNAscope HPV-test, has been recently developed. Studies have suggested that this 
      assay may become a standard to define HPV-status. METHODS: To further assess this
      test, we compared its performance against the strategies that are used in routine
      clinical practice: p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a single test and algorithms
      combining p16-IHC with HPV-DNA identification by PCR (algorithm-1) or ISH
      (algorithm-2). RESULTS: 105 OPC specimens were analyzed. The prevalence of
      HPV-positive samples varied considerably: 67% for p16-IHC, 54% for algorithm-1,
      61% for algorithm-2 and 59% for the RNAscope HPV-test. Discrepancies between the 
      RNAscope HPV-test and p16-IHC, algorithm-1 and 2 were noted in respectively
      13.3%, 13.1%, and 8.6%. The 4 diagnostic strategies were able to identify 2
      groups with different prognosis according to HPV-status, as expected. However,
      the greater survival differential was observed with the RNAscope HPV-test [HR:
      0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.07-0.51, p=0.001] closely followed by
      algorithm-1 (HR: 0.23, 95% CI, 0.08-0.66, p=0.006) and algorithm-2 (HR: 0.26, 95%
      CI, 0.1-0.65, p=0.004). In contrast, a weaker association was found when p16-IHC 
      was used as a single test (HR: 0.33, 95% CI, 0.13-0.81, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our
      findings suggest that the RNAscope HPV-test and p16-based algorithms perform
      better that p16 alone to identify OPC that are truly driven by HPV-infection. The
      RNAscope HPV-test has the advantage of being a single test.

TI  - Patella baja and total knee arthroplasty (TKA): etiology, diagnosis, and
      management.
PG  - 231-8
AB  - Patella baja, that can be divided into congenital, acquired, or a combination of 
      the two, is commonly encountered in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Congenital
      patella baja refers to a patella distal in relationship to the femoral trochlea
      and present since an early age. Acquired patella baja may occur secondary to
      distal positioning of the patella relative to the femoral trochlea or shortening 
      of the patellar tendon, as a result of trauma or surgery. Patella baja also can
      occur postoperatively as a result of scarring and shortening of the patellar
      tendon, scarring of the patellar tendon to the anterior aspect of the tibia, or
      both. Another cause of acquired patella baja seen commonly in TKA is elevation of
      the joint line, referred to as pseudo-patella baja. The patella remains in a
      normal position relative to the femoral trochlea; however, the distance between
      the patella and tibia is narrowed. Pseudo-patella baja can be a result of tibial 
      or femoral over-resection, which necessitates a large polyethylene insert.
      Alterations of the patello-tibial distance can occur during TKA by excessive
      soft-tissue release that requires elevation of the joint to regain stability and 
      placement of the patellar polyethylene component distally on the patella.
      Prevention is the easiest way to avoid potential problems with patella baja
      during TKA; however, the surgeon is often confronted with this situation during
      total knee revisions. Failure to address patella baja can lead to decreased range
      of motion (ROM), a decreased lever arm, extensor lag, impingement of the patella 
      against the tibial polyethylene or tibial plate, anterior knee pain, increased
      energy expenditure, and rupture of the patellar or quadriceps tendons. Treatment 
      of patella baja first depends on determining the cause and distinguishing between
      patella baja and pseudo-patella baja. Five different methods to measure patella
      baja are reviewed and include: (1) Blumensaat's line, (2) Insall-Salvati ratio,
      (3) Modified Insall-Salvati ratio, (4) Blackburne-Peel, and (5) Caton-Deschamps. 
      Corrective measures include reestablishing the joint line by use of distal
      femoral augments, tibial tubercle osteotomy with proximal displacement,
      lengthening of the patellar tendon, shaving of the anterior portion of the tibial
      polyethylene, and placement of the patellar implant in a cephalad position.

PG  - 1009
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2016.01009 [doi]
AB  - Molecular characterization of sequence flanking exogenous fragment insertion is
      essential for safety assessment and labeling of genetically modified organism
      (GMO). In this study, the T-DNA insertion sites and flanking sequences were
      identified in two newly developed transgenic glyphosate-tolerant soybeans GE-J16 
      and ZH10-6 based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) method. More than 22.4 Gb
      sequence data ( approximately 21 x coverage) for each line was generated on
      Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The junction reads mapped to boundaries of T-DNA
      and flanking sequences in these two events were identified by comparing all
      sequencing reads with soybean reference genome and sequence of transgenic vector.
      The putative insertion loci and flanking sequences were further confirmed by PCR 
      amplification, Sanger sequencing, and co-segregation analysis. All these analyses
      supported that exogenous T-DNA fragments were integrated in positions of Chr19:
      50543767-50543792 and Chr17: 7980527-7980541 in these two transgenic lines.
      Identification of genomic insertion sites of G2-EPSPS and GAT transgenes will
      facilitate the utilization of their glyphosate-tolerant traits in soybean
      breeding program. These results also demonstrated that WGS was a cost-effective
      and rapid method for identifying sites of T-DNA insertions and flanking sequences
      in soybean.

TI  - [Present clinical research situation of adjacent segment degeneration after
      lumbar spinal fusion].
PG  - 110-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the present clinical research situation of adjacent segment 
      degeneration (ASD) after lumbar spinal fusion. METHODS: The recent literature
      concerning ASD in the concept, the incidence, the risk factors, and prevention
      was reviewed. RESULTS: The concept of ASD includes radiographic ASD and clinical 
      ASD. The incidences of radiographic ASD and clinical ASD were 8%-100% and
      5.2%-18.5%, respectively. The risk factors for ASD include both patient and
      surgical factors. Patient factors include age, gender, preoperative condition,
      and so on. Surgical factors include the length of the fusion, mode of fusion,
      internal fixator, sagittal balance, excessive distraction of disc space, and so
      on. It can prevent ASD to reduce the length of the fusion, to keep sagittal
      balance, and to use the non-fusion technology. CONCLUSION: Many researches have
      proved that the incidence of ASD is increased after lumbar spinal fusion, and it 
      can be reduced by the non-fusion technology. Non-fusion technology has obtained
      good short-term results. But the long-term results should be further observed
      because there are some complications.

TI  - Workdays lost due to occupational injuries among young workers in Brazil.
PG  - 917-25
LID - 10.1002/ajim.22099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The severity of non-fatal work-related injuries has seldom been
      examined among young workers. We estimated the extent and distribution of
      workdays lost due to non-fatal work injuries using compensation data. METHODS:
      Data are from the Brazilian Institute of Social Insurance, for 2006. The study
      population is comprised of all insured workers of age 16-24. Descriptive
      statistics reflect workdays lost due to health-related disability, according to
      sex, age group, wage, and trade. RESULTS: Out of 4.8 million insured workers ages
      16-24 years, we estimated 1,282,940 workdays lost. We observed a larger number of
      median workdays lost among males age 20-24 in retail and service trades (83 days)
      and among 16-19-year-old females in the agriculture/fish/forestry/cattle (142
      days). CONCLUSIONS: Young workers experience a heavy burden of work-related
      injuries. Disability workdays may compromise school attendance and performance.
      Other potential impacts affect productivity and social insurance costs.

TI  - A synthetic chalcone as a potent inducer of glutathione biosynthesis.
PG  - 1382-8
LID - 10.1021/jm2016073 [doi]
AB  - Chalcones continue to attract considerable interest due to their
      anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties. We recently reported the ability
      of 2',5'-dihydroxychalcone (2',5'-DHC) to induce both breast cancer resistance
      protein-mediated export of glutathione (GSH) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated
      increased intracellular GSH levels. Herein, we report a structure-activity
      relationship study of a series of 30 synthetic chalcone derivatives with
      hydroxyl, methoxyl, and halogen (F and Cl) substituents and their ability to
      increase intracellular GSH levels. This effect was drastically improved with one 
      or two electrowithdrawing groups on phenyl ring B and up to three methoxyl and/or
      hydroxyl groups on phenyl ring A. The optimal structure,
      2-chloro-4',6'-dimethoxy-2'-hydroxychalcone, induced both a potent NF-E2-related 
      factor 2-mediated transcriptional response and an increased formation of
      glutamate cysteine ligase holoenzyme, as shown using a human breast cancer cell
      line stably expressing a luciferase reporter gene driven by antioxidant response 
      elements.

TI  - A phase III trial to confirm modified S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy for pathological 
      stage II/III vulnerable elderly gastric cancer patients who underwent gastric
      resection (JCOG1507, BIRDIE).
PG  - 1101-1104
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyy152 [doi]
AB  - Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 is a standard treatment for patients with stage
      II/III gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy; however, this is not uniformly
      applicable in older patients. The Stomach Cancer Study Group of the Japan
      Clinical Oncology Group conducted a questionnaire survey on older patients aged
      >/=80 years and revealed wide heterogeneity among older patients of similar
      chronological age. This randomized trial aims to confirm the superiority of
      modified S-1 treatment (reduced initial dose of S-1 by >/= 1 level compared with 
      the standard dose) versus surgery alone in vulnerable older (>/=80 years old)
      patients with pathological stage II/III gastric cancer after curative resection. 
      A total of 370 patients will be enrolled from 62 institutions over 4.5 years. The
      primary endpoint of this study is overall survival. This trial has been
      registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry with code UMIN000025742

AB  - This work investigates a method for digital holographic imaging of
      microparticles. Traditional digital holographic techniques use a particle's
      forward scattered light to form the hologram, whereas here we use the
      backscattered light. Images of a particle are then computationally reconstructed 
      from the backscatter hologram, and several examples of such reconstructions are
      presented. A potential advantage of this technique is that the backscatter
      holograms may be more sensitive to particle-surface details.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of single-dose rosiglitazone in chronic ambulatory peritoneal
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 685-90
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2710.2008.00967.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with marked alterations 
      in the pharmacokinetics of many drugs, not only from reduction in renal clearance
      but also from changes in metabolic activity, bioavailability, volume of
      distribution and plasma protein binding. OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacokinetics
      of a single 8-mg oral dose of rosiglitazone in patients with ESRD and requiring
      long-term chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). METHOD: The medication
      was administered just before the first exchange of peritoneal dialysis fluid on
      the day that blood and peritoneal dialysate collection was performed. RESULTS: In
      our CAPD patients the mean (+/-SD) T(max) and T(1/2) of rosiglitazone were 1.20
      +/- 0.26 and 21.38 +/- 21.96 h respectively. These values were different to those
      reported for healthy volunteers reported in previous studies. The mean area under
      the concentration-time curve (AUC((0-infinity))) and an average maximum observed 
      plasma concentration (C(max)) of rosiglitazone in our CAPD patients were 4203.56 
      +/- 2916.97 ng h/mL and 409.67 +/- 148.89 ng/mL respectively. These appear no
      different from those reported in healthy volunteers . CONCLUSION: The apparently 
      significant difference in T(1/2) of rosiglitazone in CAPD patients compared with 
      healthy volunteers suggest that dose adjustment may be necessary in order to
      avoid toxicity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the nonclinical outcomes of a proactive palliative care
      program funded and operated by a health system for Medicare Advantage plan
      beneficiaries. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective study using propensity-based 
      matching. SETTING: A health system in southern California. PARTICIPANTS:
      Individuals who received the intervention between 2007 and 2014 (n = 368) were
      matched with 1,075 comparison individuals within each of four disease groups:
      cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and dementia. All
      were known to be dead at the time of the retrospective study, were Medicare
      Advantage beneficiaries, and had 2 years of usage data before death. Median age
      at death for each disease group was older than 80. INTERVENTION: Home- and
      clinic-based palliative care (PC) services provided by a multidisciplinary team. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes included hospital costs, other healthcare costs,
      readmission rates, hospital admissions and bed days, intensive care unit use in
      final 30 days of life, and death within 30 days of an admission. RESULTS:
      Intervention participants in all four disease groups had less hospital use and
      lower hospital costs nonintervention participants, which drove lower overall
      healthcare costs. In the final 6 months of life, healthcare costs for the
      intervention groups stayed largely the same from month to month, whereas costs
      for comparison participants increased dramatically. CONCLUSION: In the context of
      an alternative payment model in which the provider was "at risk" of bearing the
      costs of care, a proactive PC program helped to avoid the escalation in hospital 
      use and costs commonly seen in the final months of life.

TI  - Association of DHODH haplotype variants and response to leflunomide treatment in 
      rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1427-34
LID - 10.2217/pgs.12.118 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Leflunomide is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug used in the treatment 
      of rheumatoid arthritis. Not all patients respond to leflunomide and, as it has
      potentially serious side effects, targeting only those most likely to benefit
      would address a clinical need. We aimed to determine whether variations in the
      gene encoding DHODH, the molecular target of leflunomide, might include
      biomarkers that could be used to rationalize provision of this drug. MATERIALS & 
      METHODS: We analyzed six haplotype-tagging SNPs in DHODH in 56 patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis treated with leflunomide. Clinical response was determined
      by assessing the change in 28 joint disease activity score over the first 3
      months of treatment. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Carriage of a six-marker DHODH
      haplotype was associated with a reduced treatment response (p = 0.008). This
      suggests that a functional variant in strong linkage disequilibrium with this
      haplotype may predispose to reduced leflunomide efficacy.

TI  - The role of active zone protein Rab3 interacting molecule 1 alpha in the
      regulation of norepinephrine release, response to novelty, and sleep.
PG  - 821-31
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.03.047 [doi]
AB  - Sleep mechanisms and synaptic plasticity are thought to interact to regulate
      homeostasis and memory formation. However, the influences of molecules that
      mediate synaptic plasticity on sleep are not well understood. In this study we
      demonstrate that mice lacking Rab3 interacting molecule 1 alpha (RIM1 alpha)
      (Rim1 alpha KO), a protein of the synaptic active zone required for certain types
      of synaptic plasticity and learning, had 53+/-5% less baseline rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep compared with their wild type littermates. Also, compared with wild
      type littermates, exposure of the mice to an open field or to a novel object
      induced more robust and longer lasting locomotion suggesting altered habituation.
      This difference in exploratory behavior correlated with genotype specific changes
      in REM and deregulated release of norepinephrine in the cortex and basal amygdala
      of the Rim1 alpha KO mice. Also, moderate sleep deprivation (4 h), a test of the 
      homeostatic sleep response, induced REM sleep rebound with different time course 
      in Rim1 alpha KO and their wild type littermates. As norepinephrine plays an
      important role in regulating arousal and REM sleep, our data suggest that
      noradrenergic deficiency in Rim1 alpha KO animals impacts exploratory behavior
      and sleep regulation and contributes to impairments in learning.

TI  - Epidemiology of elephantiasis with special emphasis on podoconiosis in Ethiopia: 
      A literature review.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - Elephantiasis is a symptom of a variety of diseases that is characterized by the 
      thickening of the skin and underlying tissues, especially in the legs, male
      genitals and female breasts. Some conditions having this symptom include:
      Elephantiasis nostras, due to longstanding chronic lymphangitis; Elephantiasis
      tropica or lymphatic filariasis, caused by a number of parasitic worms,
      particularly Wuchereria bancrofti; non-filarial elephantiasis or podoconiosis, an
      immune disease caused by heavy metals affecting the lymph vessels; proteus
      syndrome, the genetic disorder of the so-called Elephant Man, etc. Podoconiosis
      is a type of lower limb tropical elephantiasis distinct from lymphatic
      filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis affects all population at risk, whereas
      podoconiosis predominantly affects barefoot subsistence farmers in areas with red
      volcanic soil. Ethiopia is one of the countries with the highest number of
      podoconiosis patients since many people are at risk to red-clay soil exposure in 
      many parts of the country. The aim of this review was to know the current status 
      and impact of podoconiosis and its relevance to elephantiasis in Ethiopia. To
      know the epidemiology and disease burden, the literatures published by different 
      scholars were systematically reviewed. The distribution of the disease and
      knowledge about filarial elephantiasis and podoconiosis are not well known in
      Ethiopia. It is relatively well studied in southern Ethiopia but data from other 
      parts of the country are limited. Moreover, programmes that focus on diagnosis,
      treatment, prevention and control of filarial elephantiasis and podoconiosis are 
      also non-existent even in endemic areas. Furthermore, the disease mapping has not
      been carried out country-wide. Therefore, in order to address these gaps,
      Ethiopian Ministry of Health needs to take initiative for undertaking concrete
      research and mapping of the disease in collaboration with stakeholders.

      to lose weight.
PG  - 251-60
LID - 10.1007/s10935-013-0309-0 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine characteristics and behaviors of 
      college students who perceive themselves as underweight or about the right
      weight, yet report trying to lose weight, as compared to their counterparts.
      Participants included 944 students (M = 20.4 years, 61.1 % White; 64.7 % female) 
      at a southwestern university. A composite of perceived weight and weight-related 
      behavior was created. Participants who reported they were under- or about the
      right weight and trying to lose weight were included in this composite group.
      Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses were run to assess characteristics
      and behaviors of the composite group. Individuals in this group were
      significantly more likely to be women, in a fraternity/sorority, have a lower
      body mass index, engage in regular vigorous physical activity, exercise and/or
      diet to lose weight, and engage in unhealthy weight-control behaviors. These
      individuals were not more likely than their counterparts to consume 5 or more
      servings of fruits/vegetables daily, to engage in moderate physical activity, or 
      to report smoking cigarettes in the past month. Further research is needed to
      understand why individuals who perceive themselves as under- or about the right
      weight engage in certain weight-loss behaviors. Interventions to target
      weight-related perceptions and behaviors among college-age individuals may need
      to address unhealthy weight-control measures.

TI  - Use of rituximab in combination with conventional chemotherapy for the treatment 
      of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the head and neck.
PG  - 475-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rituximab, an anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody that
      specifically depletes mature B cells, is an effective single agent in the
      treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas, and has been shown to
      improve the survival rate of elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma 
      when used in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and
      prednisone (CHOP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The combined effect of rituximab and
      CHOP has been comparatively studied against CHOP alone in 18 elderly patients
      with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the head or neck treated in the 1st Department of 
      Otolaryngology at Hippokration Hospital between January 1998 and January 2004.
      RESULTS: Response rates were 91% and 100% in patients treated with rituximab plus
      CHOP and with CHOP alone, respectively. Overall survival and disease-free
      survival rates were 91% in the rituximab plus CHOP group, compared with 83% and
      60%, respectively, in the CHOP alone group (p=0.75 and p=0.24 for the differences
      between the groups, respectively). The rituximab plus CHOP therapy was generally 
      well tolerated, with few adverse events reported. CONCLUSION: The results of this
      small case series, although not statistically significant, suggest that rituximab
      in combination with CHOP may represent an effective treatment option for elderly 
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the head and neck.

LID - 10.1038/s41430-017-0046-1 [doi]
AB  - The accuracy of an infrared three-dimensional (3D) body scanner in determining
      body composition was compared against hydrostatic weighing (HW), bioelectrical
      impedance analysis (BIA), and anthropometry. A total of 265 adults (119 males;
      age = 22.1 +/- 2.5 years; body mass index = 24.5 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)) had their body 
      fat percent (BF%) estimated from 3D scanning, HW, BIA, skinfolds, and girths. A
      repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences 
      among methods (p < 0.001). Multivariate ANOVA indicated a significant main effect
      of sex and method (p < 0.001), with a non-significant interaction (p = 0.101).
      Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons identified that BF% from 3D scanning (18.1 +/-
      7.8%) was significantly less than HW (22.8 +/- 8.5%, p < 0.001), BIA (20.1 +/-
      9.1%, p < 0.001), skinfolds (19.7 +/- 9.7%, p < 0.001), and girths (21.2 +/-
      10.4%, p < 0.001). The 3D scanner decreased in precision with increasing
      adiposity, potentially resulting from inconsistences in the 3D scanner's analysis
      algorithm. A correction factor within the algorithm is required before infrared
      3D scanning can be considered valid in measuring BF%.

TI  - A R2R3-MYB transcription factor from Lablab purpureus induced by drought
      increases tolerance to abiotic stress in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1089-100
LID - 10.1007/s11033-016-4042-7 [doi]
AB  - Few regulators for drought tolerance have been identified in Lablab purpureus
      which is a multipurpose leguminous crop. The transcription factor MYB is involved
      in regulatory networks in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants. A
      novel R2R3-MYB factor in L. purpureus has been identified. An suppression
      subtraction hybridization (SSH) library was constructed using root tissues of L. 
      purpureus MEIDOU 2012 from well-watered and water-stress treatments that were
      subjected to drought stress for 10 days. In addition, the cDNA of LpMYB1 was
      identified based on the SSH library. The cDNA of LpMYB1 is 858 bp and encodes a
      285-amino acid protein with a calculated mass of 33.4 kDa. The LpMYB1 protein
      localizes to the nucleus and has transactivation activity with the activation
      domain in the C terminal region of the protein. In LpMYB1 overexpressed
      Arabidopsis, the tolerance of transgenic seedlings to drought and salt was
      improved, and the germination potential of transgenic seeds increase in the
      presence of NaCl or ABA. LpMYB1 is a drought-responsive R2R3-MYB factor that can 
      increase the drought and salt tolerance of LpMYB1-overexpressed Arabidopsis.

TI  - Institutional factors and HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria.
PG  - 139-51
AB  - This paper outlines the principal institutional factors affecting the slow
      progress in reaching agreed targets in Africa regarding the prevention and
      control of HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. It focuses on three key factors: political
      analysis, strategic business approach and international inputs. Most of the
      analyses tend to look at the technical aspects of disease prevention and control,
      of political analysis there is a marked absence. Yet, we know that wider
      contextual or macro factors such as power and political decision making can make 
      or break a programme. Many senior managers in public sector institutions are
      preoccupied with day-to-day work. Successful businesses in the private sector
      have some things in common with each other. Outstanding leadership, a strategic
      and action orientated culture, highly focused on comparative strengths on
      priorities and quality being some of the key ones. Adopting such successful
      business characteristics might make the difference to public institutions. The
      move to results based institutions by focussing on outputs and outcomes is for
      the better. However, we still need to rigorously examine the quality of inputs
      that the increasing availability of funds is being used on. This is especially so
      in relation to needing a better balance between aid for health services and that 
      for institutional and health systems development. In addition, technical advisers
      from development partners need to work more across a ministry of health on
      institutional and management change to have a greater impact on achieving
      targets.

TI  - Correlation of chest computed tomography findings with dyspnea and lung functions
      in post-tubercular sequelae.
PG  - 592-599
AB  - AIMS: To study the correlation between dyspnea, radiological findings, and
      pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with sequelae of pulmonary
      tuberculosis (TB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical history, chest computed
      tomography (CT), and PFT of patients with post-TB sequelae were recorded. Dyspnea
      was graded according to the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. CT
      scans were analyzed for fibrosis, cavitation, bronchiectasis, consolidation,
      nodules, and aspergilloma. Semi-quantitative analysis was done for these
      abnormalities. Scores were added to obtain a total morphological score (TMS). The
      lungs were also divided into three zones and scores added to obtain the total
      lung score (TLS). Spirometry was done for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
      expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC. RESULTS: Dyspnea was present in
      58/101 patients. A total of 22/58 patients had mMRC Grade 1, and 17/58 patients
      had Grades 2 and 3 dyspnea each. There was a significant difference in median
      fibrosis, bronchiectasis, nodules (P < 0.01) scores, TMS, and TLS (P < 0.0001)
      between dyspnea and nondyspnea groups. Significant correlations were obtained
      between grades of dyspnea and fibrosis (r = 0.34, P = 0.006), bronchiectasis (r =
      0.35, P = 0.004), nodule (r = 0.24, P = 0.016) scores, TMS (r = 0.398, P =
      0.000), and TLS (r = 0.35, P = 0.0003). PFTs were impaired in 78/101 (77.2%)
      patients. Restrictive defect was most common in 39.6% followed by mixed in 34.7%.
      There was a negative but statistically insignificant trend between PFT and
      fibrosis, bronchiectasis, nodule scores, TMS, and TLS. However, there were
      significant differences in median fibrosis, cavitation, and bronchiectasis scores
      in patients with normal, mild to moderate, and severe respiratory defects. No
      difference was seen in TMS and TLS according to the severity of the respiratory
      defect. CONCLUSION: Both fibrosis and bronchiectasis correlated with dyspnea and 
      with PFT. However, this correlation was not linear. The overall extent of
      radiological abnormalities correlated only with dyspnea but not with PFT.

TI  - Structure of msj-1 gene: a comparative analysis.
PG  - 406-9
AB  - Msj-1 gene encodes a DnaJ protein highly expressed in spermatids and spermatozoa 
      of both rodents and amphibians. We isolated and characterized the msj-1 gene in
      mice. A bioinformatic approach was then used to predict the putative promoter
      region, chromosomal localization, and its presence in the human genome. The
      analysis of msj-1 genomic sequence revealed that msj-1 is an intronless gene.
      Interestingly, two regions (A and B, separated by 10,682 bp) on human chromosome 
      2 having respectively 78% and 77% nucleotide identity with the murine msj-1
      coding region were identified. This suggests the existence of an msj-1-like gene 
      also in humans.

TI  - Medication adherence interventions for heart failure patients: A meta-analysis.
PG  - 395-404
LID - 10.1177/1474515115571213 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to medications is an essential part of heart failure
      self-care. Poor medication adherence leads to increased rates of exacerbation
      causing hospitalizations and increased morbidity and mortality. AIMS: This
      meta-analysis aimed to quantify the effect of interventions to improve adherence 
      to heart failure medications on adherence outcomes. METHODS: Comprehensive search
      methods identified studies testing interventions designed to improve medication
      adherence among patients with heart failure. Data from eligible studies were
      independently coded by two coders and analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis
      methods. Moderator analyses to explain heterogeneity among the studies were
      conducted using meta-regression and ANOVA for moderators with sufficient numbers 
      of comparisons. RESULTS: Searching yielded 6665 potential study reports. From
      these studies, we identified 29 eligible treatment versus control comparisons of 
      heart failure medication adherence interventions (total n=4285). The mean effect 
      size (d-index) for two-group comparisons was 0.29 (SE=0.09, p=0.004). Moderator
      analyses found effect sizes were larger as samples were older. Medication
      adherence effect sizes were larger for studies conducted in Europe or Asia versus
      North America, and for interventions focused on changing only medication
      adherence. Smaller effect sizes were seen for interventions with components
      directed at health care providers, and those including social support as an
      intervention component. CONCLUSION: While the medication adherence effect size
      across all studies was significant, the effect was modest. Approaches to
      improving heart failure medication adherence may be most effective when focused

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) are leading
      causes of mortality and morbidity in western countries and also responsible of a 
      huge burden in terms of disability, functional decline, and healthcare costs.
      Biomarkers are measurable biological elements that reflect particular
      physiological or pathological states or predisposition towards diseases and they 
      are currently widely studied in medicine and especially in CD. In this context,
      biomarkers can also be used to assess the severity or the evolution of several
      diseases, as well as the effectiveness of particular therapies. Genomics,
      transcriptomics, and proteomics have opened new windows on disease phenomena and 
      may permit in the next future an effective development of novel diagnostic and
      prognostic medicine in order to better prevent or treat CD. This review will
      consider the current evidence of novel biomarkers with clear implications in the 
      improvement of risk assessment, prevention strategies, and medical decision
      making in the field of CD.

TI  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging More Accurately Classifies Steatosis and Fibrosis in
      Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Than Transient Elastography.

LID - S0016-5085(15)01734-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Noninvasive methods have been evaluated for the assessment of 
      liver fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD). We compared the ability of transient elastography (TE) with the M-probe,
      and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to assess liver fibrosis. Findings from
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based proton density fat fraction (PDFF)
      measurements were compared with those from TE-based controlled attenuation
      parameter (CAP) measurements to assess steatosis. METHODS: We performed a
      cross-sectional study of 142 patients with NAFLD (identified by liver biopsy;
      mean body mass index, 28.1 kg/m(2)) in Japan from July 2013 through April 2015.
      Our study also included 10 comparable subjects without NAFLD (controls). All
      study subjects were evaluated by TE (including CAP measurements), MRI using the
      MRE and PDFF techniques. RESULTS: TE identified patients with fibrosis stage >/=2
      with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve value of
      0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.89), whereas MRE identified these
      patients with an AUROC curve value of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.96; P = .001).
      TE-based CAP measurements identified patients with hepatic steatosis grade >/=2
      with an AUROC curve value of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.64-0.81) and PDFF methods identified
      them with an AUROC curve value of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82-0.97; P < .001). Measurement
      of serum keratin 18 fragments or alanine aminotransferase did not add value to TE
      or MRI for identifying nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: MRE and PDFF
      methods have higher diagnostic performance in noninvasive detection of liver
      fibrosis and steatosis in patients with NAFLD than TE and CAP methods. MRI-based 
      noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis and steatosis is a potential alternative
      to liver biopsy in clinical practice. UMIN Clinical Trials Registry No.

TI  - Influence of endotoxin-induced sepsis on the requirements of propofol-fentanyl
      infusion rate in pigs.
PG  - 192-6
AB  - Endotoxin-induced sepsis in pigs is a recognized experimental model for the study
      of human septic shock. Generally, pigs are brought into general anaesthesia
      before sepsis is induced. It is our experience that drug dosages of propofol and 
      fentanyl need to be reduced during endotoxin-induced sepsis, in order to prevent 
      respiratory and cardiovascular depression, but the scientific evidence for this
      observation is lacking. Therefore, we measured the consumption of propofol and
      fentanyl at equal level of anaesthesia in pigs with (n = 5) and without (n = 5)
      endotoxin-induced sepsis, using the cerebral state index (CSI) as measure of
      anaesthetic depth. Infusion rates of propofol (P < 0.01) and fentanyl (P < 0.05) 
      were significantly lower in septic pigs. Pigs with endotoxin-induced sepsis had
      an infusion rate of 2.2 mg/kg/hr (S.D. 0.5) for propofol and 12 microg/kg/hr
      (S.D. 2) for fentanyl, whereas healthy pigs had infusion rates of 3.5 mg/kg/hr
      (S.D. 0.6) and 17 microg/kg/hr (S.D. 4), respectively. CSI was equal in both
      groups throughout the experiment, and had a lowest average value of 47 (S.D. 10) 
      at t = 30 in healthy pigs and reached a highest average value of 67 (S.D. 19) at 
      t = 240 in pigs with endotoxin-induced sepsis. Anaesthetic depth was sufficient, 
      assessed clinically, throughout the experiment in both groups. We concluded that 
      the consumption of propofol and fentanyl was significantly reduced in pigs with
      endotoxin-induced sepsis. In the present study, we adjusted the level of
      anaesthesia according to clinical signs, and found good agreement with CSI.

TI  - Impacts of natural factors and farming practices on greenhouse gas emissions in
      the North China Plain: A meta-analysis.
PG  - 6702-6715
LID - 10.1002/ece3.3211 [doi]
AB  - Requirements for mitigation of the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG)
      emissions are much needed for the North China Plain (NCP). We conducted a
      meta-analysis of 76 published studies of 24 sites in the NCP to examine the
      effects of natural conditions and farming practices on GHG emissions in that
      region. We found that N2O was the main component of the area-scaled total GHG
      balance, and the CH 4 contribution was <5%. Precipitation, temperature, soil pH, 
      and texture had no significant impacts on annual GHG emissions, because of
      limited variation of these factors in the NCP. The N2O emissions increased
      exponentially with mineral fertilizer N application rate, with y =
      0.2389e(0.0058x) for wheat season and y = 0.365e(0.0071x) for maize season.
      Emission factors were estimated at 0.37% for wheat and 0.90% for maize at
      conventional fertilizer N application rates. The agronomic optimal N rates (241
      and 185 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively) exhibited great potential 
      for reducing N2O emissions, by 0.39 (29%) and 1.71 (56%) kg N2O-N ha(-1)
      season(-1) for the wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Mixed application of
      organic manure with reduced mineral fertilizer N could reduce annual N2O
      emissions by 16% relative to mineral N application alone while maintaining a high
      crop yield. Compared with conventional tillage, no-tillage significantly reduced 
      N2O emissions by ~30% in the wheat season, whereas it increased those emissions
      by ~10% in the maize season. This may have resulted from the lower soil
      temperature in winter and increased soil moisture in summer under no-tillage
      practice. Straw incorporation significantly increased annual N2O emissions, by
      26% relative to straw removal. Our analysis indicates that these farming
      practices could be further tested to mitigate GHG emission and maintain high crop
      yields in the NCP.

      a 99% coverage in infants younger than 1 year. We present a case of Kawasaki
      disease with skin lesions at the site of BCG. Clinicians should be aware of this 
      clinical manifestation that could help diagnose atypical or incomplete cases of
      the disease.

AB  - Micellization of selected quaternary ammonium compounds derived from heptacaine
      have been studied by absorption spectroscopy in the UV/VIS spectral region with
      the use of a pyrene probe. The compounds studied in the aqueous solution have
      been marked as H22, H26, H27, H29, H34, H + Al and H + B and the derivative
      marked as H34 was studied in a 3 mol/l ethanol solution at the temperature of 25 
      degrees C. In the homologous series of the studied bromides H22, H26, H27 and
      H29, cmc was observed to be dependent on the number of carbon atoms nc in the
      hydrophobic chain: ln (cmc) = -3.131-0.421nC. The Free Gibbs energy necessary for
      the transfer of a methyl group of the alkyl chain from the water phase to the
      inner part of the micelle at the temperature of 25 degrees C is (-0.421 +/-
      0.034)RT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that fasting blood glucose and insulin levels
      are higher in schizophrenic subjects on clozapine monotherapy compared with
      healthy controls and they correlate with anthropometric measurements, laboratory 
      tests and body composition. METHODS: Data for 24 subjects with schizophrenia
      treated with clozapine and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers was
      analyzed. RESULTS: Patients taking clozapine had higher fasting levels of glucose
      (103.5+/-31.6 vs. 87.8+/-11.7mg/dL, z=-2.03, p=0.04), there was no difference for
      insulin concentrations and markers of insulin resistance. In the clozapine group 
      glucose levels correlated with clozapine dose (R=-0.43, p=0.03), while insulin
      levels correlated with weight (R=0.66, p<0.001), body mass index (R=0.54,
      p=0.007), abdominal (R=0.53, p=0.007) and waist (R=0.43, p=0.04) circumference,
      total body fat (R=0.51, p=0.01), and uric acid levels (R=0.50, p=0.01). In the
      clozapine group insulin levels were lower in subjects with body mass index
      <25kg/m(2) (7.0+/-3.3 vs. 13.4+/-8.8muU/mL, p=0.04) and in subjects without
      abdominal obesity (6.3+/-2.4 vs. 13.3+/-8.6muU/mL, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We found
      higher blood glucose levels in subjects taking clozapine and no differences in
      blood insulin levels between subjects with schizophrenia and controls.
      Associations between blood insulin levels and abdominal/waist circumferences
      support the role of abdominal obesity as an important risk factor of insulin
      resistance.

TI  - Impaired B cell inhibition by lupus bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells is caused 
      by reduced CCL2 expression.
PG  - 5306-14
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1400036 [doi]
AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from healthy human and normal mice can inhibit
      normal B cell proliferation, differentiation, and Ab secretion in vitro. However,
      it remains unknown whether MSC from lupus-like mice and patients with systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit the same immunoregulatory activity as normal
      MSC for B cell inhibition and, if not, what the underlying molecular mechanism
      would be. In this study, we showed that bone marrow-derived MSCs from lupus-like 
      mice and SLE patients had an impairment in suppressing normal B cell
      proliferation and differentiation, which was caused by the reduction of CCL2
      levels. Knockdown of CCL2 in normal MSC damaged their suppressive capacity for B 
      cells. Conversely, overexpression of CCL2 in lupus MSCs restored their
      immunoregulatory ability for B cells in vitro and ameliorated the pathology of
      lupus nephritis and serological changes in MRL/lpr mice in vivo. Mechanistically,
      MSC-mediated B cell inhibition was dependent on matrix metalloproteinase
      proteolytic processing of CCL2. These findings reveal a novel function of CCL2 in
      B cell regulation by MSCs and suggest that CCL2 manipulation on MSCs may serve as
      a potential pathway for developing the more effective MSC-based therapy in
      autoimmune diseases associated with B cell activation, such as SLE.

TI  - Species differences in cannabinoid receptor 2 and receptor responses to cocaine
      self-administration in mice and rats.
PG  - 1037-51
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.297 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of functional cannabinoid receptors 2 (CB2Rs) in brain suggests a
      potential new therapeutic target for neurological and psychiatric disorders.
      However, recent findings in experimental animals appear controversial. Here we
      report that there are significant species differences in CB2R mRNA splicing and
      expression, protein sequences, and receptor responses to CB2R ligands in mice and
      rats. Systemic administration of JWH133, a highly selective CB2R agonist,
      significantly and dose-dependently inhibited intravenous cocaine
      self-administration under a fixed ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement in mice,
      but not in rats. However, under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of
      reinforcement, JWH133 significantly increased breakpoint for cocaine
      self-administration in rats, but decreased it in mice. To explore the possible
      reasons for these conflicting findings, we examined CB2R gene expression and
      receptor structure in the brain. We found novel rat-specific CB2C and CB2D mRNA
      isoforms in addition to CB2A and CB2B mRNA isoforms. In situ hybridization
      RNAscope assays found higher levels of CB2R mRNA in different brain regions and
      cell types in mice than in rats. By comparing CB2R-encoding regions, we observed 
      a premature stop codon in the mouse CB2R gene that truncated 13 amino-acid
      residues including a functional autophosphorylation site in the intracellular
      C-terminus. These findings suggest that species differences in the splicing and
      expression of CB2R genes and receptor structures may in part explain the
      different effects of CB2R-selective ligands on cocaine self-administration in
      mice and rats.

AB  - Intestinal microflora plays a pivotal role in the development of the innate
      immune system and is essential in shaping adaptive immunity. Dysbacteriosis of
      intestinal microflora induces altered immune responses and results in disease
      susceptibility. Dendritic cells (DCs), the professional antigen-presenting cells,
      have gained increasing attention because they connect innate and adaptive
      immunity. They generate both immunity in response to stimulation by pathogenic
      bacteria and immune tolerance in the presence of commensal bacteria. However, few
      studies have examined the effects of intestinal dysbacteriosis on DCs. In this
      study, changes of DCs in the small intestine of mice under the condition of
      dysbacteriosis induced by ceftriaxone sodium were investigated. It was found that
      intragastric administration of ceftriaxone sodium caused severe dysteriosis in
      mice. Compared with controls, numbers of DCs in mice with dysbacteriosis
      increased significantly (P = 0.0001). However, the maturity and
      antigen-presenting ability of DCs were greatly reduced. In addition, there was a 
      significant difference in secretion of IL-10 and IL-12 between DCs from mice with
      dysbacteriosis and controls. To conclude, ceftriaxone-induced intestinal
      dysbacteriosis strongly affected the numbers and functions of DCs. The present
      data suggest that intestinal microflora plays an important role in inducing and
      maintaining the functions of DCs and thus is essential for the connection between
      innate and adaptive immune responses.

TI  - Kawasaki's disease with paralytic ileus. A case report.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - The authors report on an 18 month-old boy affected by Kawasaki's disease (KD).
      The diagnosis of KD was made after exclusion of conditions with similar
      presentation. Two days after admission the child presented vomiting, abdominal
      distension, meteorism and increase of scrotal swelling with edema. An abdominal
      X-ray showed the presence of multiple water and gas levels in the ileum and
      subsequent diagnosis of paralitic ileus was made. After several evacuative enema 
      the intestinal symptomatology resolved. The patient was treated twice (2 g/kg day
      and after 3 days again 2 g/kg day) with intravenous immunoglobulin following
      which he made an uneventful recovery. The authors conclude that the presence of
      paralytic ileus in a febrile child may represent an unusual clinical sign of KD
      and justify a timely commencement of intravenous immuno-globulin therapy.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess safety and efficacy of a new
      modified live-virus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) genotype
      1 vaccine in pregnant sows at various stages of gestation under field conditions.
      A total of 505 sows and gilts were allocated to two treatment groups and
      maintained in separate facilities. Animals of group 1 were vaccinated with a
      commercial modified live genotype 1 PRRSV vaccine (control product, CP), while
      animals of group 2 were immunized with a new modified live genotype 1 PRRSV
      vaccine (investigational veterinary product, IVP) (ReproCyc(R) PRRS EU,
      Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica GmbH). Injection site reactions were noted to be
      significantly less frequent in the IVP group compared to the CP group for pain
      (p=0.039), redness (p=0.030), heat (p=0.016) and swelling (p=0.002). The mean
      total number of piglets alive at weaning did not differ significantly between
      both study groups (10.6 vs. 11.0, p=0.375). However, pre-weaning mortality was
      significantly higher (p=0.005) in piglets from the CP group (14.1% vs. 10.9%).
      Analyses of reproductive performance data for both groups did not result in
      statistically significant differences between CP group and IVP group for number
      of piglets alive (12.7 and 12.6, respectively), healthy live (11.9 and 11.8),
      weak (0.7 and 0.5), stillborn (1.0 and 0.8) and mummified piglets (0.3 and 0.2)
      per litter. No differences were detected between both groups for piglet birth
      weights, while body weights at weaning (7.2kg vs. 6.6kg, p=0.026) and average
      daily gain (0.2445kg vs. 0.2211kg, p=0.037) were significantly higher in piglets 
      from the IVP group. In conclusion, the administration of a single dose of
      ReproCyc(R) PRRS EU to sows and gilts at various stages of gestation confirmed
      non-inferiority to a commercial PRRS vaccine regarding safety and efficacy
      parameters under field conditions.

TI  - Dendrites determine the contribution of after depolarization potentials (ADPs) to
      generation of repetitive action potentials in hypothalamic gonadotropin
      releasing-hormone (GnRH) neurons.
PG  - 39-53
LID - 10.1007/s10827-008-0095-5 [doi]
AB  - The impact of structure in modulating synaptic signals originating in dendrites
      is widely recognized. In this study, we focused on the impact of dendrite
      morphology on a local spike generating mechanism which has been implicated in
      hormone secretion, the after depolarization potential (ADP). Using
      multi-compartmental models of hypothalamic GnRH neurons, we systematically
      truncated dendrite length and determined the consequence on ADP amplitude and
      repetitive firing. Decreasing the length of the dendrite significantly increased 
      the amplitude of the ADP and increased repetitive firing. These effects were
      observed in dendrites both with and without active conductances suggesting they
      largely reflect passive characteristics of the dendrite. In order to test the
      findings of the model, we performed whole-cell recordings in GnRH neurons and
      elicited ADPs using current injection. During recordings, neurons were filled
      with biocytin so that we could determine dendritic and total projection (dendrite
      plus axon) length. Neurons exhibited ADPs and increasing ADP amplitude was
      associated with decreasing dendrite length, in keeping with the predictions of
      the models. Thus, despite the relatively simple morphology of the GnRH neuron's
      dendrite, it can still exert a substantial impact on the final neuronal output.

TI  - [Prenatal diagnosis of isolated otocefalia. Usefulness of three-dimensional
      ultrasound].
PG  - 493-6
AB  - Otocephaly is a rare and lethal congenital malformation characterized by the
      presence of agnathia, microstomia, aglossia and synotia. Despite its frequent
      association with severe malformations, diagnosis in the few published cases is
      usually made at III trimester. In this case, three-dimensional ultrasound scan
      was performed in a Chinese primigravida with no remarkable personal nor familiar 
      history since mandible was difficulty visualized with two-dimensional sonography 
      at 21 weeks of gestation. Multiplanar and rendering mode showed the typical
      cervicofacial features of otocephaly without associated malformations. After
      parental counselling, they opted for termination of pregnancy and necropsy
      confirmed our prenatal findings. Our case shows the usefulness of
      three-dimensional ultrasound in assessing fetal cervicofacial pathology.
      Volumetric capture allows a delayed study of fetal anatomy and multiplanar mode
      offers the reconstruction of views whose achivement is difficult with
      conventional 2D ultrasound. Surface rendering provides excellent spatial vision
      and enables parents to understand the severity of the malformation thus helping
      with their decisions.

TI  - Association of low plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios with increased imminent risk for
      mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 354-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: To develop preventive therapy for Alzheimer disease (AD), it is
      essential to develop AD-related biomarkers that identify at-risk individuals in
      the same way that cholesterol levels identify persons at risk for heart disease. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma levels of amyloid beta protein (Abeta40
      and Abeta42) are useful for identifying cognitively normal elderly white subjects
      at increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. DESIGN: Using
      well-established sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, plasma Abeta40 and 
      Abeta42 levels were analyzed at baseline in a prospective, elderly white cohort
      followed up for 2 to 12 (median, 3.7) years to detect incident cases of MCI or
      AD. SETTING: Cognitively normal, community-based white volunteers recruited from 
      primary care settings into the Mayo Rochester Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry.
      Patients We followed up 563 cognitively normal white volunteers (median age, 78
      years; 62% female) who had at least 1 follow-up visit after measurement of
      baseline plasma Abeta levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time
      to development of MCI or AD. The secondary outcome was the annualized rate of
      cognitive change in patients for whom we had 2 Mattis Dementia Rating Scale
      evaluations 3 to 7 years apart. RESULTS: During follow-up, 53 subjects developed 
      MCI or AD. Subjects with plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios in the lower quartiles
      showed significantly greater risk of MCI or AD (P = .04, adjusted for age and
      apolipoprotein E genotype). Comparison of subjects with plasma Abeta42/Abeta40
      ratios in the lowest vs the highest quartile gave a relative risk of 3.1 (95%
      confidence interval, 1.1-8.3). After adjusting for age and apolipoprotein E
      genotype, regression analysis using annualized changes in the Dementia Rating
      Scale scores as an outcome variable showed that participants with lower
      Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios had greater cognitive decline (P = .02). CONCLUSION: The
      plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio may be a useful premorbid biomarker for identifying 
      cognitively normal elderly white subjects who are at increased risk for
      developing MCI or AD.

TI  - Gender differences in ankylosing spondylitis-associated cumulative healthcare
      utilization: a population-based cohort study.
PG  - 251-4
LID - S1807-59322011000200012 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is one of the most common rheumatic
      diseases with gender differences in prevalence and clinical presentation. This
      study aimed to examine whether such gender differences are correlated with
      cumulative healthcare utilization in Taiwan. METHODS: The National Health
      Insurance Research Database supplied claim records of one million individuals
      from 1996 to 2007. Selected cases included patients aged >16 years. Certified
      rheumatologists diagnosed the patients in three or more visits and gave
      prescriptions for AS. Multivariate adjusted logistic regression analyses were
      used to calculate the influence of gender on cumulative healthcare utilization
      associated with AS. RESULTS: The study included 228 women and 636 men. After
      adjustment for potential confounding factors, men had more cumulative outpatient 
      visits associated with AS (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 -2.23;
      p = 0.008). Men also exhibited a trend for higher frequency of AS-related
      hospitalization (p = 0.054). CONCLUSION: Men are more likely to have high
      cumulative AS-associated healthcare utilization than women. Further investigation
      of the causal factors is warranted.

AB  - Mycobacterium sp. strain MFM001 (MFM001), a new strain of slow-growing
      nontuberculous mycobacteria not associated with the Mycobacterium avium complex, 
      led to disseminated mycobacterial disease characterized by transmural
      granulomatous gastroenterocolitis of lepromatous type in a cat treated with
      immunosuppressive medication. MFM001 was found to be closely related to M.
      kyorinense or M. celatum by partial sequence of 16S rDNA, and identical with an
      unspecified M. sp. strain B10-07.09.0206 isolated from a human pulmonary
      infection in Germany. MFM001 should be considered as a pathogenic organism in
      cats, especially in immunocompromised animals.

TI  - Lung cancer screening: is it time for a change in policy?
PG  - 441-8
AB  - Two recent studies of computed tomography (CT) as a screening test for lung
      cancer have heightened debate about this topic. Although the International Early 
      Lung Cancer Action Program investigators (N Engl J Med 2006; 355:1763-1771)
      concluded that annual CT screening can detect lung cancer that is curable, Bach
      et al (JAMA 2007; 297:953-961) concluded that it may not meaningfully reduce the 
      risk of advanced lung cancer or death from lung cancer. We feel that questions
      remain about the degree of reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality, the
      potential morbidity caused by screening, the appropriate group to screen, and the
      cost-effectiveness of screening. These questions warrant further study prior to
      accepting CT screening as the standard of care. Hopefully, much of this knowledge
      will be gained when the results of ongoing controlled studies are available.

AB  - The goal of this article is to provide a practical approach to the imaging
      interpretation of sphenoid sinus pathology. Basic anatomy and physiology is
      reviewed first. This is followed by a discussion of the imaging modalities used
      to evaluate the sphenoid sinuses and how to differentiate a benign from an
      aggressive lesion. Finally, disease entities are discussed, with attention to
      clinical presentation, expected imaging appearance, and treatment. Although the
      focus is on sphenoid sinus pathology, the concepts presented can be applied to
      interpretation of disease in any paranasal sinus.

TI  - Peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness changes after macular photocoagulation 
      for clinically significant diabetic macular edema.
PG  - 67-70
LID - 10.1016/j.sjopt.2014.10.002 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of macular photocoagulation (MPC) on
      peripapillary nerve fiber layer (PNFL) thickness measurement in patients with
      clinically significant diabetic macular edema (CSME). METHODS: This study was a
      prospective interventional case series. Patients with CSME underwent MPC. Optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) was used to measure the PNFL and central macular
      thicknesses before and 3 months after MPC. RESULTS: Thirty-three eyes of 25
      patients with a mean age of 59.4 +/- 7.2 years were included. There was no
      statistically significant difference between pre- and post-MPC mean best
      corrected visual acuity (0.35 +/- 0.29 and 0.40 +/- 0.23 LogMAR, respectively, P 
      = 0.2). Mean baseline and 3 months central macular subfield thickness was 305.9
      +/- 90.7 and 317.5 +/- 112.4 microns, respectively (P = 0.1). Peripapillary nerve
      fiber layer thickness was 105.7 +/- 10.0 before and 106.1 +/- 9.9 three months
      after MPC (P = 0.7). No significant differences were found between pre and post
      MPC measurements in temporal, nasal, inferior and superior nerve fiber layer
      thickness in each quadrant around optic nerve head (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Macular photocoagulation has no statistically significant effect on PNFL
      thickness measurements in patients with CSME.

TI  - Rapid Assessment Medical Support (RAMS) for active shooter incidents.
PG  - 213-7
LID - 10.3109/10903127.2014.959227 [doi]
AB  - This country has witnessed a steady increase in the number of active shooter
      incidents in recent years. The traditional emergency medical services (EMS)
      response to such incidents has been to stage at a safe distance until the scene
      has been secured by law enforcement. Such an approach may lead to unnecessary
      delays in medical care and potentially needless loss of life. To address this
      issue locally, the Philadelphia Fire Department (PFD) and the Philadelphia Police
      Department (PPD) collaborated to develop the Rapid Assessment Medical Support
      (RAMS) program. All PFD paramedics have been equipped and trained to move with
      PPD officers into a scene that has been cleared by police but not yet secured in 
      order to initiate emergency care, with an emphasis on hemorrhage control.
      Patients are then extracted to awaiting EMS resources in the cold zone. The
      history behind the program and the challenges and obstacles that had to be
      addressed in its development are described. These included initial and ongoing
      training and funding sources; buy-in from risk management, labor, and the
      individual providers; whether only paramedics should be included in the RAMS
      program or if the PFD's firefighter-EMTs should be included as well; the
      potential for mission creep as police recognized the value of this asset and its 
      potential application to other scenarios; and how to involve the many
      nonmunicipal ambulance services that are not involved in the routine operation of
      Philadelphia's 9-1-1 system. To date, RAMS teams have been activated on multiple 
      occasions, but fortunately the incidents were resolved without injury or loss of 
      life. However, the program provides another valuable tool with which the City of 
      Philadelphia can respond should another active shooter incident occur.

AB  - Occupational exposure poses a significant risk of transmission of blood-borne
      pathogens to healthcare workers (HCWs). Adherence to standard precautions,
      awareness about post exposure prophylaxis is poor in developing countries. This
      retrospective study analyzes the self-reported cases of occupational exposure in 
      a tertiary care hospital. During the study period, 105 HCWs sustained
      occupational exposure to blood and body fluids. Majority of the victims 36
      (34.2%) were interns and the clinical practice that led to the occupational
      exposure was withdrawal of blood (45.7%). Good infection control practices and
      emphasis on appropriate disposal are needed to increase the occupational safety
      for HCWs.

LID - 10.1007/s00216-011-5006-3 [doi]
AB  - A rapid, sensitive, and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      method for the detection of tandospirone in human plasma is described. It was
      employed in a pharmacokinetic study. The analyte and internal standard
      diphenhydramine were extracted from plasma using liquid-liquid extraction, then
      separated on a Zorbax XDB C(18) column using a mobile phase of
      methanol-water-formic acid (80:20:0.5, v/v/v). The detection was performed with a
      tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source.
      Linearity was established in the concentration range of 10.0-5,000 pg/ml. The
      lower limit of quantification was 10.0 pg/ml. The intraday and interday relative 
      standard deviation across three validation runs over the entire concentration
      range was less than 13%. Accuracy determined at three concentrations (25.0, 200, 
      and 4,000 pg/ml for tandospirone) ranged from 94.4 to 102.1%. Each plasma sample 
      was chromatographed within 3.4 min. The method proved to be highly selective and 
      suitable for bioequivalence evaluation of different formulations containing
      tandospirone and clinical pharmacokinetic investigation of tandospirone.

TI  - Regulatory Role of CD4(+) T Cells in Myocarditis.
PG  - 4396351
LID - 10.1155/2018/4396351 [doi]
AB  - Myocarditis is an important cause of heart failure in young patients.
      Autoreactive, most often, infection-triggered CD4(+) T cells were confirmed to be
      critical for myocarditis induction. Due to a defect in clonal deletion of
      heart-reactive CD4(+) T cells in the thymus of mice and humans, significant
      numbers of heart-specific autoreactive CD4(+) T cells circulate in the blood.
      Normally, regulatory T cells maintain peripheral tolerance and prevent
      spontaneous myocarditis development. In the presence of tissue damage and innate 
      immune activation, however, activated self-antigen-loaded dendritic cells promote
      CD4(+) effector T cell expansion and myocarditis. So far, a direct pathogenic
      role has been described for both activated Th17 and Th1 effector CD4(+) T cell
      subsets, though Th1 effector T cell-derived interferon-gamma was shown to limit
      myocarditis severity and prevent transition to inflammatory dilated
      cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, recent observations point out that various CD4(+) 
      T cell subsets demonstrate high plasticity in maintaining immune homeostasis and 
      modulating disease phenotypes in myocarditis. These subsets include Th1 and Th17 
      effector cells and regulatory T cells, despite the fact that there are still
      sparse and controversial data on the specific role of FOXP3-expressing Treg in
      myocarditis. Understanding the specific roles of these T cell populations at
      different stages of the disease progression might provide a key for the
      development of successful therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Ox-PAPC activation of PMET system increases expression of heme oxygenase-1 in
      human aortic endothelial cell.
PG  - 265-74
LID - 10.1194/jlr.M800317-JLR200 [doi]
AB  - Oxidized-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (Ox-PAPC) has
      been demonstrated to accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions and regulates
      expression of more than 1,000 genes in human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC).
      Among the most highly induced is heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cell-protective
      antioxidant enzyme, which is sensitively induced by oxidative stress. To identify
      the pathway by which Ox-PAPC induces HO-1, we focused on the plasma membrane
      electron transport (PMET) complex, which contains ecto-NADH oxidase 1 (eNOX1) and
      NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and affects cellular redox status by
      regulating levels of NAD(P)H. We demonstrated that Ox-PAPC and its active
      components stimulated electron transfer through the PMET complex in HAECs from
      inside to outside [as determined by extracellular
      2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(44-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (WST-1) 
      reduction] and from outside to inside of the cell (as determined by intracellular
      NBT reduction). Chemical inhibitors of PMET system and siRNAs to PMET components 
      (NQO1 and eNOX1) significantly decreased HO-1 induction by Ox-PAPC. We present
      evidence that Ox-PAPC activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2
      (Nrf2) in HAEC plays an important role in the induction of HO-1 and PMET
      inhibitors blocked Nrf2 activation by Ox-PAPC. We hypothesized that PMET
      activation by Ox-PAPC causes intracellular NAD(P)H depletion, which leads to the 
      increased oxidative stress and HO-1 induction. Supporting this hypothesis,
      cotreatment of cells with exogenous NAD(P)H and Ox-PAPC significantly decreased
      oxidative stress and HO-1 induction by Ox-PAPC. Taken together, we demonstrated
      that the PMET system in HAEC plays an important role in the regulation of
      cellular redox status and HO-1 expression by Ox-PAPC.

TI  - [Effect of Zn(II) on microbial activity in anaerobic acid mine drainage treatment
      system with biomass as carbon source].
PG  - 293-8
AB  - In this study, with rape straw as carbon source, anaerobic batch experiments were
      executed to investigate the effect of Zn (II) on the activity of sulphate
      reducing bacteria (SRB) in the microbial treatment of simulative acid mine
      drainage (AMD). The results showed that during the 60 experimental days, when
      initial Zn2+ concentrations were in the range of 73.7 to 196.8 mg x L(-1), SRB
      had high culturalbility. At the end of these experiments, pH values rose from
      initial 5.0 to neutral, about 96% of sulphate was reduced and the concentrations 
      of Zn2+ reduced to 0.05 mg x L(-1). The results of Tessier sequential extraction,
      field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction(XRD)
      showed that Zn was found to be fixed through forming organic and sulphide (mainly
      sphalerite) compounds. For the experiment with high Zn2+ concentration (262.97 mg
      x L(-1)), at the end of experiments, pH values dropped from initial 5.0 to 4.0,
      only 27% of sulphate was only reduced and the concentrations of Zn2+ kept in high
      range (25 mg x L(-1)), the activity of SRB significantly inhibited. This study
      indicated that: (1) Rape straw can be used as slow-release carbon source for
      long-term anaerobic AMD treatment; (2) Rape straw can decrease the toxicity of
      Zn2+ to SRB through adsorption; (3) In anaerobic AMD treatment system, Zn can be 
      fixed by sulphide minerals with mediation of SRB.

TI  - [Sebaceous tumors of the eyelids in a patient with Muir-Torre syndrome].
PG  - 654-8
AB  - Muir-Torre syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary condition predisposing to
      cancer. It is characterized by cutaneous tumors (such as sebaceous adenomas,
      epitheliomas, or carcinoma, and/or keratoacanthomas) and internal malignancies. A
      47-year-old male patient with cancer antecedents consulted for two tumors of the 
      eyelid. Histological study of the exeresis biopsies of the eyelid lesions showed 
      a sebaceous adenoma and an epidermoid carcinoma with sebaceous differentiation.
      With the suspicion of Muir-Torre syndrome, a genetic consultation was requested. 
      The geneticist found a mutation of the MSH2 gene, which was not classified as
      pathological. Cancer screening was begun for the patient and his descendants. The
      clinical outcome was death from urothelial carcinoma. Eyelid sebaceous tumors
      require complete medical check-up in search of carcinoma. Demonstrating
      Muir-Torre syndrome allows the medical team to propose early cutaneous and
      visceral carcinoma screening for patients, their collaterals, and their
      descendants.

AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is a human enteropathogen that can
      overcome oxidative stress and survive in macrophages. OxyR is an important part
      of the antioxidant defense system. S. Typhi expresses a virulence (Vi)
      polysaccharide capsular antigen, which provides the bacterium with the ability to
      avoid host defenses and suppress detection by the innate immune system. This
      study investigated the effect of OxyR on Vi antigen in S. Typhi. In the oxyR
      mutant strain, microarray analysis, quantitative real time PCR and
      beta-galactosidase assay confirmed that the viaB operon was positively regulated 
      by OxyR. The Vi enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry results
      showed that Vi capsule level was decreased in the oxyR mutant strain. Also, the
      EMSA revealed that OxyR directly binds to the promoter region of tviA. Thus, we
      propose that S. Typhi OxyR positively regulates expression of Vi capsule antigen 
      in a direct manner.

TI  - [The immunologic function and role of allograft inflammatory factor-1].
PG  - 139-45
AB  - Allograft inflammatory factor-1 is the protein that expressed in the macrophages 
      around the coronary arteries in rat ectopic cardiac allograft model. AIF-1 is
      produced mainly by macrophages and regulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).
      There are various splicing valiants in AIF-1, and the functions are different.
      AIF-1 has Ca-binding EF-hand motif that induces cell proliferation and migration 
      by structural features. Besides cell proliferation and migration, AIF-1
      contributes to secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6,
      IL-10, IL-12, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), insulin resistance 
      by downregulation of GLUT4 or IRS-1, and fibrosis process by upregulation of
      collagen production. It has been elucidated that AIF-1 is responsible for the
      onset of various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis,
      atherosclerotic disease, diabetes mellitus. AIF-1 may have the therapeutic
      potential for chronic inflammatory diseases by elucidation of the mechanism.

TI  - [Increased oxidative damages of erythrocytes caused by declined blood oxygen
      saturation].
PG  - 323-7
AB  - This paper was to explore the effect of blood oxygen saturation (SO2) on
      oxidative damages of erythrocytes under the condition of oxidative stress.
      Keeping SO2 of cultured erythrocytes in vitro at the states of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9
      and 0.98, respectively, we induced oxidative stress by tert-buthylhydroperoxide
      (BHP, 0.15 mmol/L of final concentration). After incubation, antioxidant capacity
      was assessed by measuring content of reduced glutathin hormone (GSH) in
      erythrocytes. Methemoglobin (MetHb) content, lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric
      acid-reactive substances, TBARS) and denatured globin-chains on the plasma
      membrane were measured to assess the extent of oxidative damages. The results
      showed that in the presence of BHP, GSH contents increased from 0.3 to 0.98
      groups; MetHb, TBARS and globin-chains levels all dropped with the rise of SO2.
      In conclusion, antioxidant capacity and oxidative damages of erythrocytes are
      closely related to SO2, declined SO2 could promote oxidative damages of
      erythrocytes.

TI  - Patterns of 12-year change in physical activity levels in community-dwelling
      older women: can modest levels of physical activity help older women live longer?
PG  - 534-43
AB  - Few studies have addressed changes in physical activity participation over time
      among the elderly. The authors hypothesized that there were distinct trajectories
      of physical activity level over time and identifiable predictors of such
      trajectories, as well as that the maintenance of regular physical activity, even 
      below recommended levels, was associated with lower mortality risk. Using
      longitudinal data (1994-2009) from 433 initially high-functioning older women
      aged 70-79 years at baseline, a joint latent class and survival mixture model
      identified 4 activity trajectory classes: always active (16.6%), fast declining
      (19.2%), stable moderate (32.3%), and always sedentary (31.9%). Obesity, coronary
      artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depressive symptoms, low
      self-efficacy, mobility disability, and low energy were associated with sedentary
      behavior and/or a fast decline in activity. Women in the fast declining and
      always sedentary classes had hazard ratios for death of 2.34 (95% confidence
      interval: 1.20, 4.59) and 3.34 (95% confidence interval: 1.72, 6.47),
      respectively, compared with the always active class; no mortality difference was 
      found between the stable moderate and always active groups (hazard ratio = 1.24, 
      95% confidence interval: 0.63, 2.47). Our findings suggest that physical activity
      does not have to be vigorous to be beneficial and that the gain may be the
      greatest among women who reported the lowest levels of activity.

AB  - Four isomorphic compounds with formula [{Co2(H2O)2(Bpe)2}(V4O12)].4H2O.Bpe, CoBpe
      1; [{CoNi(H2O)2(Bpe)2}(V4O12)].4H2O.Bpe, CoNiBpe 2;
      [{Co0.6Ni1.4(H2O)2(Bpe)2}(V4O12)].4H2O.Bpe, NiCoBpe 3; and
      [{Ni2(H2O)2(Bpe)2}(V4O12)].4H2O.Bpe, NiBpe 4, have been obtained by hydrothermal 
      synthesis. The crystal structures of CoBpe 1 and NiBpe 4 were determined by
      single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Rietveld refinement of CoNiBpe 2 and 
      NiCoBpe 3 XRD patterns confirms that those are isomorphic. The compounds
      crystallize in the P1 space group, exhibiting a crystal structure constructed
      from inorganic layers pillared by Bpe ligands. The crystal structure contains
      intralayer and interlayer channels, in which the crystallization water molecules 
      and Bpe guest molecules, respectively, are located. The solvent molecules
      establish a hydrogen bonding network with the coordinated water molecules.
      Thermodiffractometric and thermogravimetric studies showed that the loss of
      crystallization and coordinated water molecules takes place at different
      temperatures, giving rise to crystal structure transformations that involve
      important reduction of the interlayer distance, and strong reduction of
      crystallinity. The IR, Raman, and UV-vis spectra of the as-synthesized and heated
      compounds confirm that the structural building blocks and octahedral coordination
      environment of the metal centers are maintained after the structural
      transformations. The color change and reversibility of the water molecules
      uptake/removal were tested showing that the initial color is not completely
      recovered when the compounds are heated at temperatures higher than 200 degrees
      C. The thermal evolution of the magnetic susceptibility indicates one-dimensional
      antiferromagnetic coupling of the metal centers at high temperatures. For NiCoBpe
      3 and NiBpe 4 compounds magnetic ordering is established at low temperatures, as 
      can be judged by the maxima observed in the magnetic susceptibilities. CoNiBpe 2 
      was proved as catalyst being active for cyanosilylation reactions of aldehydes.

TI  - Behavioral responses to visual overstimulation in the cockroach Periplaneta
      americana L.

AB  - In the visual systems of insects, different types of photoreceptors contribute to
      specialized visual channels that mediate distinct functions and behaviors. Large 
      compound eyes of Periplaneta americana contain photoreceptors of two spectral
      classes, broadband green-sensitive photoreceptors and narrow-band UV-sensitive
      photoreceptors. Here, we investigated how visual stimulation by UV and green
      light affects locomotor, resting, and grooming behaviors in P. americana under
      conditions when light avoidance is not possible. We show that green but not UV
      light stimulates locomotor activity, inducing paradoxical positive masking.
      Duration of resting and grooming decreased with increasing light intensity,
      consistent with development of behavioral stress in response to visual
      overstimulation. A reaction of full immobility is described under UV light and at
      higher intensities of green light, with relative periods of immobility and
      grooming strongly negatively correlated. Low-intensity UV was more effective than
      low-intensity green light in suppressing grooming and inducing immobility. Our
      results suggest that locomotor activity in P. americana is mainly regulated by
      green-sensitive photoreceptors, and that dim UV light can trigger behavioral
      immobility, whereas both wavelengths induce stress-like reactions at high
      intensities. Considering the intrinsic UV sensitivity of green-sensitive
      photoreceptors, the contrasting behavioral responses indicate antagonistic
      interactions between UV and green visual channels.

AB  - One hundred cases of trichoblastomas (large nodular, small nodular, cribriform,
      lymphadenoma, and columnar) were randomly selected and studied for the presence
      of melanocytic hyperplasia in the epidermis overlying the tumors, which was
      defined as foci of increased melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis
      (more than 1 per 4 basal keratinocytes). Focal melanocytic hyperplasia was
      detected in a total of 22 cases of trichoblastoma (22%), and this phenomenon was 
      most frequently seen in columnar trichoblastoma (7 cases), followed by large
      nodular trichoblastoma (5 cases). The mechanism of epidermal melanocytic
      hyperplasia overlying trichoblastoma is unclear. Ultraviolet may be a
      contributing factor, as focal melanocytic hyperplasia was also detected in
      one-third of cases in the epidermis overlying uninvolved skin, usually associated
      with solar elastosis. This is further corroborated by the occurrence of the
      lesions predominantly on the face. Melanocytic hyperplasia overlying
      trichoblastoma appears to have no impact on the clinical appearance of the lesion
      and is recognized only microscopically. In an adequate biopsy specimen containing
      at least part of trichoblastoma, it should not cause any diagnostic problems.

TI  - Adipokine hormones and hand osteoarthritis: radiographic severity and pain.
PG  - e47860
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0047860 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity's association with hand osteoarthritis cannot be fully
      explained by mechanical loading. We examined the relationship between adipokines 
      and radiographic hand osteoarthritis severity and pain. METHODS: In a pilot study
      of 44 hand osteoarthritis patients (39 women and 5 men), serum adipokine
      concentrations and hand x-ray Kallman-scores were analyzed using linear
      regression models. Secondary analyses examined correlates of hand pain. RESULTS: 
      The cohort had a mean age of 63.5 years for women and 72.6 for men; mean
      (standard deviation) Kallman-scores were 43.3(17.4) for women and 46.2(10.8) for 
      men. Mean body-mass-index was 30 kg/m(2) for women and men. Mean leptin
      concentration was 32.2 ng/ml (women) and 18.5 ng/ml (men); mean adiponectin-total
      was 7.9 ng/ml (women) and 5.3 ng/ml (men); mean resistin was 7.3 ng/ml (women)
      and 9.4 ng/ml (men). No association was found between Kallman-scores and
      adipokine concentrations (R(2) = 0.00-0.04 unadjusted analysis, all
      p-values>0.22). Secondary analyses showed mean visual-analog-scale pain of
      4.8(2.4) for women and 6.6(0.9) for men. Leptin, BMI, and history of coronary
      artery disease were found to be associated with visual-analog-scale scores for
      chronic hand pain (R(2) = 0.36 unadjusted analysis, p-values</=0.04). CONCLUSION:
      In this pilot study, we found that adipokine serum concentrations were not
      associated with hand osteoarthritis radiographic severity; the most important
      correlates of joint damage were age and disease duration. Leptin serum
      concentration, BMI, and coronary artery disease were associated with the
      intensity of chronic hand OA pain.

LID - 10.1007/s11671-009-9383-x [doi]
AB  - We report herein a facile method for the preparation of sodium tungsten bronzes
      hollow nanospheres using hydrogen gas bubbles as reactant for chemical reduction 
      of tungstate to tungsten and as template for the formation of hollow nanospheres 
      at the same time. The chemical composition and the crystalline state of the
      as-prepared hollow Na0.15WO3nanospheres were characterized complementarily, and
      the hollow structure formation mechanism was proposed. The hollow
      Na0.15WO3nanospheres showed large Brunauer-Emment-Teller specific area (33.8 m2
      g-1), strong resistance to acids, and excellent ability to remove organic
      molecules such as dye and proteins from aqueous solutions. These illustrate that 
      the hollow nanospheres of Na0.15WO3should be a useful adsorbent.

AB  - Given predicted increases in urbanization in tropical and subtropical regions,
      understanding the processes shaping urban coral reefs may be essential for
      anticipating future conservation challenges. We used a case study approach to
      identify unifying patterns of urban coral reefs and clarify the effects of
      urbanization on hard coral assemblages. Data were compiled from 11 cities
      throughout East and Southeast Asia, with particular focus on Singapore, Jakarta, 
      Hong Kong, and Naha (Okinawa). Our review highlights several key characteristics 
      of urban coral reefs, including "reef compression" (a decline in bathymetric
      range with increasing turbidity and decreasing water clarity over time and
      relative to shore), dominance by domed coral growth forms and low reef
      complexity, variable city-specific inshore-offshore gradients, early declines in 
      coral cover with recent fluctuating periods of acute impacts and rapid recovery, 
      and colonization of urban infrastructure by hard corals. We present hypotheses
      for urban reef community dynamics and discuss potential of ecological engineering
      for corals in urban areas.

TI  - Special note: preliminary findings--epidural steroid paste in posterior lumbar
      surgery: surgical site complications in a case-controlled cohort.
PG  - E907-11
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive, case-matched
      patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of acute postoperative complications
      in patients receiving epidural steroid paste. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
      Epidural steroid agents reduce postoperative pain and inflammation after lumbar
      surgery, reducing postoperative narcotic use and improving McGill pain scores.
      Small studies have suggested an increase in surgical site infections after use of
      steroid-containing pain-paste. However, no larger study exists to address this
      concern. METHODS: A total of 364 patients undergoing lumbar decompression by
      surgeons routinely or never using an analgesic steroid paste were reviewed. A
      total of 123 patients met specific inclusion criteria: 61 steroid-paste (StP)
      group, 62 in no-paste (NoP) group. Surgical procedures were
      laminectomy/laminotomy at 1 to 2 adjacent levels. Patients undergoing
      instrumentation or revision surgery were excluded. Surgical and postoperative
      protocols were uniform. Retrospective review of clinical data assessed the
      incidence of postoperative surgical site complications. RESULTS: Patient
      demographics, characteristics, and perioperative protocols were similar. Only
      in-patient admission differed-75% in the steroid-paste (StP) group versus 45% in 
      the no-paste (NoP) group (P < 0.0001). There were 5 acute infections, 4 in the
      StP (6.7% [1.8%-15.9%]) and 1 in the NoP groups (1.67% [0.03%-8.7%]), P = 0.21.
      One additional StP patient had delayed wound healing. All StP group
      infections/complications occurred in patients with identifiable comorbid risk
      factors. CONCLUSION: The observed 4-fold increase in wound complications in the
      StP group is concerning, although the difference in infection rates was not
      significant. Stratifying patients by identifiable risk factors could account for 
      some of this difference. The benefits of an epidural agent may outweigh the small
      risk of surgical site complications in most patients, but we recommend caution
      when treating patients with identifiable risk factors. A larger study is in
      progress. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3

AB  - Evolutionary theories explaining virulence-the fitness damage incurred by
      infected hosts-often focus on parasite strategies for within-host exploitation.
      However, much virulence can be caused by the host's own immune response: for
      example, pro-inflammatory cytokines, although essential for killing malaria
      parasites, also damage host tissue. Here we argue that immune-mediated virulence,
      or 'immunopathology,' may affect malaria virulence evolution and should be
      considered in the design of medical interventions. Our argument is based on the
      ability of immunopathology to disrupt positive virulence-transmission
      relationships assumed under the trade-off theory of virulence evolution. During
      rodent malaria infections, experimental reduction of inflammation using reagents 
      approved for field use decreases virulence but increases parasite transmission
      potential. Importantly, rodent malaria parasites exhibit genetic diversity in the
      propensity to induce inflammation and invest in transmission-stage parasites in
      the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. If immunopathology positively
      correlates with malaria parasite density, theory suggests it could select for
      relatively low malaria virulence. Medical interventions which decrease
      immunopathology may therefore inadvertently select for increased malaria
      virulence. The fitness consequences to parasites of variations in immunopathology
      must be better understood in order to predict trajectories of parasite virulence 
      evolution in heterogeneous host populations and in response to medical
      interventions.

TI  - Exploring the utility of narrative analysis in diagnostic decision making:
      picture-bound reference, elaboration, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 459-74
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate classification accuracy and clinical feasibility of a
      narrative analysis tool for identifying children with a fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorder (FASD). METHOD: Picture-elicited narratives generated by 16 age-matched 
      pairs of school-aged children (FASD vs. typical development [TD]) were coded for 
      semantic elaboration and reference strategy by judges who were unaware of age,
      gender, and group membership of the participants. Receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curves were used to examine the classification accuracy of
      the resulting set of narrative measures for making 2 classifications: (a) for the
      16 children diagnosed with FASD, low performance (n = 7) versus average
      performance (n = 9) on a standardized expressive language task and (b) FASD (n = 
      16) versus TD (n = 16). RESULTS: Combining the rates of semantic elaboration and 
      pragmatically inappropriate reference perfectly matched a classification based on
      performance on the standardized language task. More importantly, the rate of
      ambiguous nominal reference was highly accurate in classifying children with an
      FASD regardless of their performance on the standardized language task (area
      under the ROC curve = .863, confidence interval = .736-.991). CONCLUSION: Results
      support further study of the diagnostic utility of narrative analysis using
      discourse level measures of elaboration and children's strategic use of
      reference.

TI  - X-ray flares from postmerger millisecond pulsars.
PG  - 1127-9
AB  - Recent observations support the suggestion that short-duration gamma-ray bursts
      are produced by compact star mergers. The x-ray flares discovered in two short
      gamma-ray bursts last much longer than the previously proposed postmerger
      energy-release time scales. Here, we show that they can be produced by
      differentially rotating, millisecond pulsars after the mergers of binary neutron 
      stars. The differential rotation leads to windup of interior poloidal magnetic
      fields and the resulting toroidal fields are strong enough to float up and break 
      through the stellar surface. Magnetic reconnection-driven explosive events then
      occur, leading to multiple x-ray flares minutes after the original gamma-ray
      burst.

TI  - Identification of perturbed signaling pathways from gene expression data using
      information divergence.
PG  - 1797-1804
LID - 10.1039/c7mb00285h [doi]
AB  - Abnormal regulation of signaling pathways is the key causative factor in several 
      diseases. Although many methods have been proposed to identify significantly
      differential pathways between two conditions via microarray gene expression
      datasets, most of them concentrate on differences in the pathway
      components-either the differential expression or the correlation of genes in a
      given pathway. However, as biological functional units, signaling pathways may
      have diverse activity patterns across different biological contexts. In order to 
      detect overall changes in pathways, we propose an analysis model called SPAID
      (Signaling Pathway Analysis based on Information Divergence). SPAID is based on
      the concept of information divergence, which can be used to compare two
      conditions by computing the differential probability distribution of the
      regulation capacity. We compared SPAID with several classical algorithms using
      different datasets, and the results indicate that SPAID produces higher
      repeatability, has better performance and universality, and extracts more
      comprehensive information regarding the underlying biological processes. In
      conclusion, by introducing the idea of information divergence, our study measures
      differences in pathways from an overall perspective and will provide a
      complementary analysis framework for pathway analysis.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of myocardial tissue from the border zone during early stage
      post-infarct remodelling in rats.
PG  - 254-63
LID - 10.1093/eurjhf/hfq196 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Long-term outcome of patients after myocardial infarction (MI) largely
      depends on the extent of post-infarct remodelling. To explore the molecular
      mechanism of remodelling, comparative proteomic analysis was undertaken to
      identify differential myocardial proteome profiles expressed in the border zone
      of the post-MI heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
      and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass
      spectrometry were used to identify the differential protein profiles expressed in
      the border zone at specific time points (Days 0, 1, 4, and 10 post-infarction) in
      a permanent rat MI model. We identified 96 differential protein spots,
      corresponding to 69 proteins. Cluster analysis exhibited five main temporal
      expression patterns corresponding to the three phases of early stage remodelling.
      The alteration in expression was supported by reverse transcription-polymerase
      chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis of three
      selected proteins. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the proteins in each
      pattern were functionally related to specific cell processes in remodelling, such
      as ischaemia, inflammation, and proliferation. CONCLUSION: A differential
      myocardial proteome profile was identified in the border zone during early stage 
      post-infarct remodelling. Bioinformatics analysis indicated a possible role of
      these proteins in remodelling. Proteomics data provided the basis for further
      functional study of these proteins and for identifying potential molecular
      targets with therapeutic anti-remodelling effects.

AB  - Dopaminergic, serotonergic, and adrenergic receptors are targets for therapeutic 
      actions in schizophrenia. Dopamine D2 receptor partial agonists such as
      aripiprazole represent a treatment option for patients with this severe disorder.
      The ineffectiveness of terguride, another D2 receptor partial agonist, in
      treating schizophrenia was recently attributed to its considerably high intrinsic
      activity at D2 receptors. In this study, we used functional assays for
      recombinant D2 receptors and native 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A),
      alpha2C-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors to compare the pharmacological
      properties of terguride and three of its halogenated derivatives (2-chloro-,
      2-bromo-, 2-iodoterguride) with those of aripiprazole. Subsequently, we studied
      the antidopaminergic effects of 2-bromoterguride using amphetamine-induced
      locomotion (AIL). Its influence on spontaneous behavior was tested in the open
      field. Extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) liability was evaluated by catalepsy
      test. In a guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding 
      assay, 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, and 2-iodoterguride produced intrinsic activities at 
      human D2short (hD2S) receptors that were half as high as the intrinsic activity
      for terguride; aripiprazole lacked agonist activity. 2-Bromoterguride and
      aripiprazole activated D2S receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation to
      the same extent; intrinsic activity was half as high as that of terguride. All
      compounds tested behaved as antagonists at human D2long/Galphao (hD2L/Galphao)
      receptors. Compared with aripiprazole, terguride and its derivatives displayed
      higher affinity at porcine 5-HT2A receptors and alpha2C-adrenoceptors and lower
      affinity at H1 receptors. 2-Bromoterguride inhibited AIL and did not induce
      catalepsy in rats. Because of its in vitro and in vivo properties,
      2-bromoterguride may be a strong candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia
      with a lower risk to induce EPS.

AB  - Microporous poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) matrices containing encapsulated
      proteins were fabricated in a solvent-free manner. Microporous foam was generated
      by saturating a mixture of polymer and protein particles in supercritical carbon 
      dioxide (SC-CO2), dispersing the protein particles in the polymer melt followed
      by a rapid evaporation of the CO2 phase. The release rates of protein
      encapsulated within porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide)(PLGA) constructs produced
      in SC-CO2 were measured in vitro. Although a substantial amount of protein was
      released within the first 48 h, results indicated that protein may be dispersed
      throughout the polymer phase and released over 3 weeks using this solvent-free
      technique. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), known to promote angiogenesis
      in vivo, was encapsulated within the polymer matrix. In addition, retention of
      biological activity was measured for bFGF encapsulated within PLGA foams.
      Encapsulated bFGF was released from the porous constructs for up to 10 days in
      vitro with little loss of biological activity.

TI  - Temporal-envelope reconstruction for hearing-impaired listeners.
PG  - 853-65
LID - 10.1007/s10162-012-0350-3 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies suggest that normal-hearing listeners maintain robust speech
      intelligibility despite severe degradations of amplitude-modulation (AM) cues, by
      using temporal-envelope information recovered from broadband frequency-modulation
      (FM) speech cues at the output of cochlear filters. This study aimed to assess
      whether cochlear damage affects this capacity to reconstruct temporal-envelope
      information from FM. This was achieved by measuring the ability of 40
      normal-hearing listeners and 41 listeners with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to
      identify syllables processed to degrade AM cues while leaving FM cues intact
      within three broad frequency bands spanning the range 65-3,645 Hz. Stimuli were
      presented at 65 dB SPL for both normal-hearing listeners and hearing-impaired
      listeners. They were presented as such or amplified using a modified half-gain
      rule for hearing-impaired listeners. Hearing-impaired listeners showed
      significantly poorer identification scores than normal-hearing listeners at both 
      presentation levels. However, the deficit shown by hearing-impaired listeners for
      amplified stimuli was relatively modest. Overall, hearing-impaired data and the
      results of a simulation study were consistent with a poorer-than-normal ability
      to reconstruct temporal-envelope information resulting from a broadening of
      cochlear filters by a factor ranging from 2 to 4. These results suggest that
      mild-to-moderate cochlear hearing loss has only a modest detrimental effect on
      peripheral, temporal-envelope reconstruction mechanisms.

TI  - The spectrum of undiagnosed hepatitis C virus infection in a US HIV clinic.
PG  - 4-9
LID - 10.1089/apc.2013.0130 [doi]
AB  - United States guidelines endorse one-time HCV antibody screening at HIV
      diagnosis. Rescreening HCV-seronegative patients on a regular basis is still not 
      policy, although HIV-infected persons have reasonably substantial HCV incidence. 
      We evaluated routine risk factor-independent HCV antibody re-testing in a Rhode
      Island HIV clinic. We instituted annual HCV antibody testing for HCV-seronegative
      patients who had not been rescreened in a year or more. Testing based on clinical
      suspicion continued. We conducted a chart review of new antibody-positive cases
      in the first year of rescreening, July 2006 to June 2007. Of 245 rescreened
      patients, 11 (4.5%) seroconverted. Five (45%) were female. Median time between
      last negative and first positive result was 32 months (range 8-98 months). Six
      (55%) had documented risk factors and 6 (55%) elevated ALT (> 45 IU/L) between
      antibody tests; none prompted re-testing. One seroconverter died of
      hepatocellular carcinoma 3.7 years after HCV diagnosis. A twelfth was rescreened 
      for suspected acute HCV based on ALT of 515 IU/L. He had newly detectable HCV RNA
      then seroconversion, and achieved SVR following 6 months of treatment in the
      acute phase for genotype 1 infection. Incident HCV is not uncommon among
      HIV-infected patients in care. Rescreening identified undiagnosed HCV in this
      population. HCV RNA should be checked promptly in HCV-seronegative persons with
      ALT elevation. We observed consequences of late diagnosis (hepatocellular
      carcinoma) and benefits of early diagnosis (cure with treatment of acute HCV).
      Adding annual rescreening to the Ryan White Program would facilitate earlier
      identification of undiagnosed HCV and create an instant widespread surveillance
      system, providing HCV incidence data.

LID - 10.1007/5584_2015_5019 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis caused by resistant M. tuberculosis strains poses a serious threat
      as it requires prolonged and costly treatment and has high mortality rate. In
      order to investigate resistance to antituberculous drugs in Croatia, we analysed 
      all resistant M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients' samples in period
      2010-2014 (1 strain per patient). Out of 2384 M. tuberculosis strains, we
      identified 88 (3.69 %) resistant strains. The analysis included resistance
      patterns, resistance conferring mutations and, according to MIRU-VNTR analysis,
      clustering and global lineages distribution. Relatively high number of strains
      was monoresistant, especially to isoniazid, while there were only six
      multiresistant strains. Among 59 strains with any pattern that includes
      resistance to isoniazid, a total of 22 (37.29 %) had resistance conferring
      mutation in katG gene (S315T), 23 (38.98 %) in inhA promoter region (C-15T) and
      14 (23.73 %) had none of these mutations. The observed clustering rate of
      resistant strains was 28.41 %, and the most common global lineage was
      Euro-American (75 %).

TI  - Incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma among lesions diagnosed as low-grade
      adenoma/dysplasia on endoscopic biopsy: A multicenter, prospective, observational
      study.
PG  - 228-235
LID - 10.1111/den.12980 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Differentiation between gastric adenocarcinoma and low-grade 
      adenoma/dysplasia (LGA) on endoscopic forceps biopsy is difficult. We aim to
      clarify the incidence of carcinoma in specimens, obtained by endoscopic resection
      (ER), from cases that had been diagnosed as LGA (Vienna category 3) on endoscopic
      biopsy. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective, observational study, patients 
      with gastric adenoma (Vienna category 3 or 4.1) diagnosed on endoscopic forceps
      biopsy were enrolled. All the specimens were subjected to histopathological
      central review. Primary endpoint was the incidence of carcinoma (Vienna category 
      4.2 or over) among the biopsy-proven gastric LGA. Secondary endpoints were the
      histological findings of resected specimens, clinicopathological features of
      carcinoma, and short-term outcomes of all ER cases. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients
      with 104 lesions diagnosed as gastric adenoma were enrolled. After central review
      of the biopsy specimens, 47 lesions were diagnosed as LGA and seven lesions (15%)
      as adenocarcinoma (95% confidence interval, 7.6-28%). Carcinoma was detected in
      lesions that had a minimum size of 6 mm; the incidence of carcinoma was higher in
      the larger lesions. There was a histological discrepancy between biopsy and ER
      material in more than 60% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of 
      biopsy-proven gastric LGA specimens were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma after ER.
      This indicated histological discrepancy between biopsy-proven gastric LGA and
      histology of the resected material.

TI  - Disease-promoting and -protective genomic loci on mouse chromosomes 3 and 19
      control the incidence and severity of autoimmune arthritis.
PG  - 336-45
LID - 10.1038/gene.2012.2 [doi]
AB  - Proteoglycan (PG)-induced arthritis (PGIA) is a murine model of rheumatoid
      arthritis. Arthritis-prone BALB/c mice are 100% susceptible, whereas the major
      histocompatibility complex-matched DBA/2 strain is completely resistant to PGIA. 
      To reduce the size of the disease-suppressive loci for sequencing and to find
      causative genes of arthritis, we created a set of
      BALB/c.DBA/2-congenic/subcongenic strains carrying DBA/2 genomic intervals
      overlapping the entire Pgia26 locus on chromosome 3 (chr3) and Pgia23/Pgia12 loci
      on chr19 in the arthritis-susceptible BALB/c background. Upon immunization of
      these subcongenic strains and their wild-type (BALB/c) littermates, we identified
      a major Pgia26a sublocus on chr3 that suppressed disease onset, incidence and
      severity via controlling the complex trait of T-cell responses. The region was
      reduced to 3 Mbp (11.8 Mbp with flanking regions) in size and contained gene(s)
      influencing the production of a number of proinflammatory cytokines.
      Additionally, two independent loci (Pgia26b and Pgia26c) suppressed the clinical 
      scores of arthritis. The Pgia23 locus ( approximately 3 Mbp in size) on chr19
      reduced arthritis susceptibility and onset, and the Pgia12 locus (6 Mbp)
      associated with low arthritis severity. Thus, we have reached the critical sizes 
      of arthritis-associated genomic loci on mouse chr3 and chr19, which are ready for
      high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated
      transcription factor belonging to a nuclear hormone receptor superfamily,
      containing three isoforms (alpha, beta/delta, and gamma). PPARs play a critical
      physiological role as a primary lipid sensor and regulator of lipid metabolism.
      Thus, its ligands are clinically used for treatment of type 2 diabetes and
      hyperlipidemia. On the other hand, PPAR ligands exert the antineuroinflammatory
      activity through preventing upregulation of inflammatory mediators in animal
      models for neurodegenerative disease and autoimmune disease. Neuropathic pain and
      inflammatory pain, clinically important one, are chronically progressed and
      underlain by neuroinflammation. In a few years, some studies using experimental
      models emerge that administration of PPAR ligands reduces inflammatory pain and
      neuropathic pain. PPAR ligands repress expression of genes for inflammatory
      mediators involved in both pains, such as proinflammatory cytokines, by a
      molecular mechanism termed ligand-dependent direct transrepression. Alternative
      mechanism is independent of transcriptional regulation of target genes, such as
      inhibition of activity of ion channels involved in the development of
      inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain, and therefore the analgesic effect occurs
      with rapid onset. The effects of PPAR ligands on neuroinflammation in animal
      models suggest their possible use for treating human inflammatory pain and
      neuropathic pain.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to present the first long-term results on
      the clinical use of compression anastomosis clips (CAC) in upper and lower
      gastrointestinal tract anastomoses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 50
      patients who underwent anastomosis of the upper (n = 32) or lower GI tract (n =
      18) with the use of CAC. In the period of 6-7 months after the surgery, patients 
      underwent endoscopic examination and computed tomography evaluation of the
      anastomosis. Each anastomosis was evaluated macro and microscopically. The width 
      of anastomoses was evaluated using a 4-point-scale for grading stenosis. RESULTS:
      Of the 50 patients who underwent anastomosis with compression anastomosis clip,
      28 (56%) patients reported to the follow-up examination within 190-209 days of
      the execution of the anastomosis. Among the 22 patients who did not report to the
      study, 18 (36%) patients died within 91-154 days from the execution of the
      anastomosis (mean 122 days), 4 (8%) patients were impossible to contact after
      discharge from hospital. Two mild stenoses (I0) were diagnosed; 1 of them was
      found in the gastroenterostomy and 1 in Braun enteroenterostomy. Microscopic
      changes were diagnosed in 4 anastomoses (3 gastroenterostomies, 1 Braun
      enteroenterostomy). Anastomoses were well-formed and wide, scars in the line of
      anastomoses were thin. CONCLUSIONS: During the period of 6 months after the
      anastomoses performed using CAC have been formed, they were evaluated as
      unobstructed and functioning properly; therefore, they can be safely performed
      within the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.

      using high pressure kinetics.
PG  - 7768-73
LID - 10.1039/c0dt00247j [doi]
AB  - Previous stopped flow kinetic experiments suggested an interchange associative
      mechanism for the ligand substitution reaction, [Fe(bztpen)(OMe)](2+) +
      H(2)O(2)--> {[Fe(bztpen)(OMe)(HOOH)](2+)}(++)--> [Fe(bztpen)(OOH)](2+) + MeOH
      (bztpen = N-benzyl-N, N',N'tris(2-methylpyridyl)-ethylenediamine). Thus a
      seven-coordinate transition state containing both the leaving methoxide and the
      incoming hydrogen peroxide ligands was proposed. On the basis of high pressure
      kinetic data we can now conclude that this is not the case since the rate of the 
      reaction is independent of pressure for the formation of the purple low spin
      transient hydroperoxido complex, [Fe(bztpen)(OOH)](2+). [Fe(bztpen)(OOH)](2+) has
      so far proved to be too short-lived for solid state isolation. As part of our
      ongoing pursuit of this elusive species we have structurally characterised the
      nitrosyl and acetate iron(II) complexes, [Fe(bztpen)(NO)](OTf)(2) and
      [Fe(bztpen)(OAc)](BPh(4)), as well as the air stable Co(II) complexes
      [Co(bztpen)Cl)]BF(4), [Co(metpen)Cl]SbF(6) and [Co(bztpen)(OAc)]BPh(4). We did
      not realise our aim of accessing stable Co(III) hydroperoxido or peroxido
      complexes by reaction of the cobalt complexes with H(2)O(2).

      purported biomarkers have been independently validated. We propose the need for a
      new paradigm in biobanking; simply pursuing larger numbers of participants,
      larger networks of biobanks and higher sample integrity will not, in itself,
      transform the success rate or efficiency of biomarker research. We propose that
      biobanks must embrace the intrinsic observational nature of biospecimens and
      furnish the recipients of biospecimens with the population metrics (descriptive
      statistics) that can facilitate the scientific rigor that is mandated in other
      areas of observational research. In addition, we discuss the value of
      population-based ascertainment and recruitment and the importance of the timing
      of biospecimen collections. Any assessment of biospecimen quality must go beyond 
      the sample itself and consider both the patient/participant selection and the
      most appropriate and informative timing for specimen collection, particularly
      prior to any treatment intervention in diseased populations. The examples and
      rationales that we present are based largely on cancer-related collections
      because the feasibility of population metrics is greatly assisted by the
      comprehensive registries that are more common for cancer than other chronic
      diseases. Changing the biobanking paradigm from tacitly 'experimental' to
      explicitly 'observational' represents a profound but urgent methodological shift 
      that will influence the establishment, management, reporting and impact of
      biobanks in the twenty-first century.

      study.
PG  - 11084-92
AB  - The relative stabilities of 2- and 3-acetylthiophenes have been evaluated by
      experimental thermochemistry and the results compared to high-level ab initio
      calculations. The enthalpies of combustion, vaporization, and sublimation were
      measured by rotating-bomb combustion calorimetry, Calvet microcalorimetry,
      correlation gas chromatography, and Knudsen effusion techniques and the gas-phase
      enthalpies of formation, at T = 298.15 K, were determined. Standard ab initio
      molecular orbital calculations at the G2 and G3 levels were performed, and a
      theoretical study on the molecular and electronic structures of the compounds
      studied has been conducted. Calculated enthalpies of formation using atomization 
      and isodesmic reactions are compared with the experimental data. Experimental and
      theoretical results show that 2-acetylthiophene is thermodynamically more stable 
      than the 3-isomer. A comparison of the substituent effect of the acetyl group in 
      benzene and thiophene rings has been carried out.

PG  - 18-26

AB  - The female condom remains the sole female-initiated method of dual protection
      against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmissible infections (STIs),
      including HIV. We reviewed published data on the effectiveness and acceptability 
      of the female condom for protection against pregnancy and infection. Overall, use
      of the female condom is low and several barriers hinder the wider adoption of the
      use of the method. Research on effectiveness has focussed on pregnancy, STIs and 
      biological markers of semen exposure. Although the data available suggest that
      female condoms (or a mixture of female and male condoms) may provide similar
      degrees of protection against pregnancy and STIs as do latex male condoms alone, 
      this conclusion has not been demonstrated and thus comparative research is
      urgently needed.

TI  - Laboratory and field testing of bednet traps for mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae)
      sampling in West Java, Indonesia.
PG  - 187-96

AB  - Surveillance of medically important mosquitoes is critical to determine the risk 
      of mosquito-borne disease transmission. The purpose of this research was to test 
      self-supporting, exposure-free bednet traps to survey mosquitoes. In the
      laboratory we tested human-baited and unbaited CDC light trap/cot bednet (CDCBN) 
      combinations against three types of traps: the Mbita Trap (MIBITA), a Tent Trap
      (TENT), and a modified Townes style Malaise trap (TSM). In the laboratory, 16
      runs comparing MBITA, TSM, and TENT to the CDCBN were conducted for a total of 48
      runs of the experiment using 13,600 mosquitoes. The TENT trap collected
      significantly more mosquitoes than the CDCBN. The CDCBN collected significantly
      more than the MBITA and there was no difference between the TSM and the CDCBN.
      Two field trials were conducted in Cibuntu, Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia. The
      first test compared human-baited and unbaited CDCBN, TENT, and TSM traps during
      six nights over two consecutive weeks per month from January, 2007 to September, 
      2007 for a total of 54 trapnights. A total of 8,474 mosquitoes representing 33
      species were collected using the six trapping methods. The TENT-baited trap
      collected significantly more mosquitoes than both the CDCBN and the TSM. The
      second field trial was a comparison of the baited and unbaited TENT and CDCBN
      traps and Human Landing Collections (HLCs). The trial was carried out from
      January, 2008 to May, 2008 for a total of 30 trap nights. A total of 11,923
      mosquitoes were collected representing 24 species. Human Landing Collections
      captured significantly more mosquitoes than either the TENT or the CDCBN. The
      baited and unbaited TENT collected significantly more mosquitoes than the CDCBN. 
      The TENT trap was found to be an effective, light-weight substitute for the CDC
      light-trap, bednet combination in the field and should be considered for use in
      surveys of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, arboviruses, and filariasis.

TI  - Corin in natriuretic peptide processing and hypertension.
PG  - 415
LID - 10.1007/s11906-013-0415-7 [doi]
AB  - Corin is a serine protease originally isolated from the heart. Functional studies
      show that corin is the long-sought enzyme responsible for activating cardiac
      natriuretic peptides. In mice, lack of corin prevents natriuretic peptide
      processing, causing salt-sensitive hypertension. In humans, corin variants and
      mutations that reduce corin activity have been identified in patients with
      hypertension and heart failure. Decreased plasma levels of corin antigen and
      activity have been reported in patients with heart failure and coronary artery
      disease. Low levels of urinary corin also have been found in patients with
      chronic kidney disease. Most recent studies show that corin also acts in the
      uterus to promote spiral artery remodeling and prevent pregnancy-induced
      hypertension. Here, we review the role of corin in natriuretic peptide processing
      and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, pre-eclampsia,
      and chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Role of Vitamin D in the Hygiene Hypothesis: The Interplay between Vitamin D,
      Vitamin D Receptors, Gut Microbiota, and Immune Response.
PG  - 627
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00627 [doi]
AB  - The hygiene hypothesis postulates that higher levels of cleanliness and improper 
      exposure to microorganisms early in childhood could disturb the intestinal
      microbiome resulting in abnormal immune responses. Recently, more attention has
      been put on how a lack of sun exposure and consequently vitamin D deficiency
      could lead to less immune tolerance and aberrant immune responses. Moreover,
      vitamin D receptor (VDR) function has been positioned to be a critical aspect of 
      immune response and gut homeostasis. Therefore, this review focuses on the role
      that the interaction between vitamin D, VDR function, and gut microbiome might
      have on autoimmune diseases in the context of the hygiene hypothesis. Literature 
      shows that there is a high correlation between vitamin D deficiency, VDR
      dysfunction, gut microbiota composition, and autoimmune diseases. The
      biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, serves as the primary ligand 
      for VDRs, which have been shown to play a fundamental role in reducing autoimmune
      disease symptoms. Although the biological functions of VDR, the effects of its
      genetic variants, and the effects of epigenetic profiles in its promoter region
      are largely unknown in humans, studies in murine models are increasingly
      demonstrating that VDRs play a crucial role in attenuating autoimmune disease
      symptoms by regulating autophagy and the production of antimicrobial peptides,
      such cathelicidin and beta-defensin, which are responsible for modifying the
      intestinal microbiota to a healthier composition. Remarkably, evidence shows that
      hormonal compounds and byproducts of the microbiota such as secondary bile acids 
      might also activate VDR. Therefore, understanding the interaction between VDR and
      gut microbiota is of the utmost importance toward understanding the rise in
      autoimmune diseases in Western countries. We have gained insights on how the VDR 
      functions affects inflammation, autophagy, and microbiota composition that could 
      lead to the development of pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, while confirming 
      the role vitamin D and VDRs have in the context of hygiene hypothesis.

TI  - Effects of murine norovirus on atherosclerosis in ldlr(-/-) mice depends on the
      timing of infection.
PG  - 114-22
AB  - We previously reported that murine norovirus (MNV), a virus prevalent in United
      States research institutions, increased atherosclerotic lesion size in Ldlr(-/-) 
      mice when the mice were infected 8 wk after feeding an atherogenic diet. To
      determine whether the timing of MNV infection relative to atherosclerosis
      development altered the disease phenotype and to examine potential mechanisms by 
      which MNV influences the disease process, we fed Ldlr(-/-) mice an atherogenic
      diet for 16 wk. Three days after initiating the atherogenic diet, half of the
      mice received MNV4 and the other half vehicle only (clarified cell-culture
      lysate; controls). Both groups of mice developed large aortic sinus lesions
      (control compared with MNV4: 133 +/- 8 x 10(3) mum(2) compared with 140 +/- 7 x
      10(3) mum(2)) that were not significantly different in size. Because the timing
      of MNV infection relative to atherosclerosis development and hypercholesterolemia
      differed between our previous and the current studies, we examined whether
      hypercholesterolemia altered MNV4-induced changes in bone-marrow-derived
      macrophages. MNV4 infection increased the potential of macrophages to take up and
      store cholesterol by increasing CD36 expression while suppressing the ABCA1
      transporter. Thus, the effects of MNV4 infection on atherosclerotic lesion size
      appear to be dependent on the timing of the infection: MNV4 infection promotes
      only established lesions. This effect may be due to MNV4's ability to increase
      cholesterol uptake and decrease efflux by regulating CD36 and ABCA1 protein
      expression.

TI  - Usefulness of an early neurofunctional assessment in predicting
      neurodevelopmental outcome in very low birthweight infants.
PG  - F111-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether early neurofunctional assessment may be useful in 
      predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in children of very low birth weight
      (VLBW). DESIGN: Observational longitudinal study. SETTINGS: Northern Italy.
      PATIENTS: A total of 250 VLBW children (129 boys, 121 girls) born consecutively
      1996-1999. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurodevelopment at 36 months of chronological 
      age, classified in accordance with the classification of Tardieu and the
      International classification of functioning. RESULTS: Of the infants exhibiting
      normal neurodevelopment (n = 183) or major dysfunction (n = 17) at 3 months of
      corrected age, 72% and 94% respectively did not change their score during the
      study. Minor dysfunctions at 3 months of corrected age were transient in 17 (34%)
      children. After adjustment for neonatal variables, neurodevelopment at 3 months
      of corrected age remained predictive of dysfunction at 36 months (odds ratio =
      4.33, 95% confidence interval 2.05 to 9.12). If the results for the normal and
      minor dysfunction groups were pooled, the predictive qualities of the 3 month
      neurofunctional assessment were: sensitivity 0.5, specificity 0.99, positive
      predictive value 0.94, negative predictive value 0.93. CONCLUSION: Early
      neurofunctional evaluation may be useful in predicting later neurodevelopmental
      outcome in VLBW children.

TI  - Increasing the frequency of hand washing by healthcare workers does not lead to
      commensurate reductions in staphylococcal infection in a hospital ward.
PG  - 114
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-8-114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is generally considered to be the most important measure
      that can be applied to prevent the spread of healthcare-associated infection
      (HAI). Continuous emphasis on this intervention has lead to the widespread
      opinion that HAI rates can be greatly reduced by increased hand hygiene
      compliance alone. However, this assumes that the effectiveness of hand hygiene is
      not constrained by other factors and that improved compliance in excess of a
      given level, in itself, will result in a commensurate reduction in the incidence 
      of HAI. However, several researchers have found the law of diminishing returns to
      apply to hand hygiene, with the greatest benefits occurring in the first 20% or
      so of compliance, and others have demonstrated that poor cohorting of nursing
      staff profoundly influences the effectiveness of hand hygiene measures.
      Collectively, these findings raise intriguing questions about the extent to which
      increasing compliance alone can further reduce rates of HAI. METHODS: In order to
      investigate these issues further, we constructed a deterministic Ross-Macdonald
      model and applied it to a hypothetical general medical ward. In this model the
      transmission of staphylococcal infection was assumed to occur after contact with 
      the transiently colonized hands of HCWs, who, in turn, acquire contamination only
      by touching colonized patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact
      of imperfect hand cleansing on the transmission of staphylococcal infection and
      to identify, whether there is a limit, above which further hand hygiene
      compliance is unlikely to be of benefit. RESULTS: The model demonstrated that if 
      transmission is solely via the hands of HCWs, it should, under most
      circumstances, be possible to prevent outbreaks of staphylococcal infection from 
      occurring at a hand cleansing frequencies < 50%, even with imperfect hand
      hygiene. The analysis also indicated that the relationship between hand cleansing
      efficacy and frequency is not linear--as efficacy decreases, so the hand
      cleansing frequency required to ensure R0 < 1 increases disproportionately.
      CONCLUSION: Although our study confirmed hand hygiene to be an effective control 
      measure, it demonstrated that the law of diminishing returns applies, with the
      greatest benefit derived from the first 20% or so of compliance. Indeed, our
      analysis suggests that there is little benefit to be accrued from very high
      levels of hand cleansing and that in most situations compliance > 40% should be
      enough to prevent outbreaks of staphylococcal infection occurring, if
      transmission is solely via the hands of HCWs. Furthermore we identified a
      non-linear relationship between hand cleansing efficacy and frequency, suggesting
      that it is important to maximise the efficacy of the hand cleansing process.

TI  - Substrate effect on refractive index dependence of plasmon resonance for
      individual silver nanoparticles observed using darkfield microspectroscopy.
PG  - 2668-77
AB  - We use optical darkfield micro-spectroscopy to characterize the plasmon resonance
      of individual silver nanoparticles in the presence of a substrate. The optical
      system permits multiple individual nanoparticles to be identified visually for
      simultaneous spectroscopic study. For silver particles bound to a silanated glass
      substrate, we observe changes in the Plasmon resonance due to induced variations 
      in the local refractive index. The shifts in the plasmon resonance are
      investigated using a simple analytical theory in which the contributions from the
      substrate and environment are weighted with distance from the nanoparticle. The
      theory is compared with experimental results to determine a weighting factor
      which facilitates modeling of environmental refractive index changes using
      standard Mie code. Use of the optical system for characterizing nanoparticles
      attached to substrates for biosensing applications is discussed.

TI  - Ganglioside GM3 inhibits the high glucose- and TGF-beta1-induced proliferation of
      rat glomerular mesangial cells.
PG  - 2540-51
AB  - Abrupt proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) is a common feature in 
      the early stage of diabetic glomerulopathy, and ganglioside GM3
      (NeuAcalpha3Galbeta4Glcbeta1Cer) is thought to regulate the proliferation of many
      cell types. Recently, we have reported ganglioside GM3 as a modulator of
      glomerular hypertrophy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats []. This study
      examined whether modulation of cellular ganglioside GM3 could regulate the high
      glucose- and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced proliferation
      of GMCs. To pharmacologically modulate the cellular ganglioside GM3, GMCs
      originated from rat kidneys were cultured with exogenous ganglioside GM3 or
      d-threo-PDMP, an inhibitor of ganglioside synthesis, in the RPMI 1640 media
      containing normal (5.6 mM, NG) or high (25 mM, HG) glucose. HG, TGF-beta1 (10
      ng/ml) and d-threo-PDMP (20 microM) significantly stimulated the mesangial cell
      proliferation, whereas these increments were remarkable attenuated by exogenous
      ganglioside mixture (0.1-0.2 mg/ml) or GM3 (20-100 microM) in a dose-dependent
      manner. The mesangial cell proliferation caused by HG, TGF-beta1 and d-threo-PDMP
      was closely correlated with decreases in both cellular sialic acid contents and
      ganglioside GM3 synthase activity. Based upon the mobility on high-performance
      thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), GMCs showed a complex pattern of ganglioside
      expression that consisted, at least, of five different components of
      gangliosides, mainly ganglioside GM3. HG, TGF-beta1 and d-threo-PDMP induced a
      significant reduction of ganglioside expression with apparent changes in the
      composition of ganglioside GM3, and semi-quantitative analysis by HPTLC showed
      that ganglioside GM3 expression reduced to about 35-54% of control. These results
      provide a pathophysiological link between mesangial cell proliferation and
      ganglioside GM3 expression, indicating that exogenously added ganglioside GM3
      inhibits the high-ambient glucose- and TGF-beta1-induced proliferation of
      cultured GMCs.

TI  - BcMctA, a putative monocarboxylate transporter, is required for pathogenicity in 
      Botrytis cinerea.
PG  - 545-53
LID - 10.1007/s00294-015-0474-1 [doi]
AB  - Monocarboxylate transporters have a central role in mammalian metabolism, but
      rarely reported in phytopathogenic fungi. In this study, a putative
      monocarboxylate transporter gene in Botrytis cinerea [B. cinerea MctA (BcMctA)]
      was identified in the research of a B. cinerea transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertional
      mutant (74). Disruption of the gene decreased the growth rate on the medium with 
      monocarboxylate (acetate or pyruvate) as the sole carbon sources, but not
      affected on lactate. The pyruvate contents in BcmctA deletion mutants decreased
      about 35 % compared with the wild strain. Besides, the conidial yield was
      increased about two times in BcmctA disruption mutant. The pathogenicity assay
      indicated that disruption of BcmctA significantly reduced the virulence of B.
      cinerea on cucumber and tomato leaves. Our results demonstrated that BcMctA is
      related to pyruvate uptake and pathogenicity of B. cinerea on cucumber and tomato
      leaves.

TI  - Fast-tracking in outpatient surgery.
PG  - 635-9
AB  - Fast-tracking in outpatient surgery is a new paradigm that allows for rapid
      throughput and early discharge, thereby facilitating perioperative efficiency.
      Compared with the conventional recovery process, bypassing the postanesthesia
      care unit reduces the time to discharge home. An ideal anesthetic technique for
      fast-tracking would provide for rapid emergence and the prevention of common
      postoperative complications such as pain, nausea, and vomiting using a multimodal
      approach.

AB  - The pathogenesis of canine chronic valvular disease (CVD) is not fully
      characterized. The present study investigates the expression of genes encoding
      matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in normal
      and diseased mitral valves (MVs). Samples from normal (n=15) or diseased (n=10)
      canine MVs were subject to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
      quantification of mRNA encoding MMP-1, -2, -9 and -14 and TIMP-2, -3 and -4. In
      normal valves there was low expression of mRNA encoding MMP-2, -9 and -14 and
      TIMP-3. In the valves from dogs with CVD there was significantly increased
      transcription of mRNA encoding MMP-1 and -14 and TIMP-2, -3 and -4, but no
      elevation in mRNA encoding MMP-2 and -9. MMPs and TIMPs are therefore likely to
      be involved in extracellular matrix metabolism in normal canine MVs and there are
      significant alterations in the expression of genes encoding these molecules
      during CVD.

AB  - Experiments have shown that people can rapidly determine if categories such as
      "animal" or "beach" are present in scenes that are presented for only a few
      milliseconds. Typically, observers in these experiments report on one
      prespecified category. For the first time, we show that observers can rapidly
      extract information about multiple categories. Moreover, we demonstrate
      task-dependent interactions between accumulating information about different
      categories in a scene. This interaction can be constructive or destructive,
      depending on whether the presence of one category can be taken as evidence for or
      against the presence of the other.

AB  - Epitopes from all available full-length sequences of yellow fever virus (YFV) and
      dengue fever virus (DENV) restricted by Human Leukocyte Antigen class I (HLA-I)
      alleles covering 12 HLA-I supertypes were predicted using the NetCTL algorithm. A
      subset of 179 predicted YFV and 158 predicted DENV epitopes were selected using
      the EpiSelect algorithm to allow for optimal coverage of viral strains. The
      selected predicted epitopes were synthesized and approximately 75% were found to 
      bind the predicted restricting HLA molecule with an affinity, K(D), stronger than
      500 nM. The immunogenicity of 25 HLA-A*02:01, 28 HLA-A*24:02 and 28 HLA-B*07:02
      binding peptides was tested in three HLA-transgenic mice models and led to the
      identification of 17 HLA-A*02:01, 4 HLA-A*2402 and 4 HLA-B*07:02 immunogenic
      peptides. The immunogenic peptides bound HLA significantly stronger than the
      non-immunogenic peptides. All except one of the immunogenic peptides had K(D)
      below 100 nM and the peptides with K(D) below 5 nM were more likely to be
      immunogenic. In addition, all the immunogenic peptides that were identified as
      having a high functional avidity had K(D) below 20 nM. A*02:01 transgenic mice
      were also inoculated twice with the 17DD YFV vaccine strain. Three of the YFV
      A*02:01 restricted peptides activated T-cells from the infected mice in vitro.
      All three peptides that elicited responses had an HLA binding affinity of 2 nM or
      less. The results indicate the importance of the strength of HLA binding in
      shaping the immune response.

TI  - Validation of an instrument to assess factors associated with adherence to

PG  - 9-15
AB  - Accidents with biological material are a reality in dental practice. The use of
      preventive measures such as the adoption of Standard Precautions (SP) is
      essential, thus this study aims to validate an instrument to check factors
      associated with adherence to SP among dentists. The scales of psychosocial and
      organizational factors that influence adherence to SP were the starting point.
      These scales have already been nationally validated for doctors and nurses. The
      instrument consisted of 49 items divided into five dimensions. The process of
      instrument validation involved the following steps: its adaptation for situations
      that pose risks to dentists; content and semantic analysis by a committee of
      judges, and application to dentists. The adapted instrument was applied to 224
      dentists who provided primary healthcare in the north region of Parana State.
      After the application of scales, the psychometric properties were analyzed using 
      the factor analysis technique and a reliability test. The factor analysis
      confirmed three domains: Obstacles to following standard precautions; Knowledge
      of occupational transmission of HIV and Safety climate. The reliability of the
      domains was considered adequate (Cronbach's alpha between 0.73 and 0.88.). The
      instrument demonstrated adequate psychometric properties to assess factors that
      influence adherence to SP among dentists.

      multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 619-25
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S3501 [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder of the central
      nervous system. The clinical course of MS varies among patients. Currently,
      interferon (IFN) products, including IFN beta-1a administered intramuscularly or 
      subcutaneously and IFN beta-1b subcutaneously, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab,
      and mitoxantrone are approved disease-modifying therapies for the treatment of
      relapsing-remitting MS. Cladribine, also known as 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, is a
      synthetic adenosine deaminase-resistant purine nucleoside analog that
      preferentially depletes lymphocyte subpopulations. This sustained effect on
      lymphocytes is advantageous for patients with MS. CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets
      Treating MS OrallY), a Phase III trial, has demonstrated that short-term oral
      cladribine decreases relapse rates and risk of disability progression in
      comparison with placebo. Cladribine was well tolerated in the study, with the
      most common adverse effects being headache, nausea, upper respiratory tract
      infections, and lymphocytopenia. An ongoing study is evaluating the efficacy and 
      safety of the combination of oral cladribine and IFN-beta products. A further
      ongoing study is examining the use of oral cladribine in clinically isolated
      syndrome and time to conversion to MS. Although the results of CLARITY are
      promising, the exact role of oral cladribine may be better defined with the
      completion of ongoing studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare the knowledge and attitudes of the physicians
      and nurses towards the advance directives. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional
      pilot study. SETTING: East healthcare area of the Community of Madrid (Spain)
      PARTICIPANTS: Primary care and specialized care physicians and nurses. MAIN
      MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaire about knowledge, use and attitudes from the
      healthcare professionals over the advance directives given, with dichotomous and 
      Likert scale (0-10) variables. RESULTS: Replies were received from a total of 192
      physicians and nurses (response rate=83,4%), 72,4% were women and 27,6% were men.
      The mean age was 39,6 years (SD=10,86). For general knowledge on advance
      directives the median was 5 (RI=3-7). 60,1% were aware of the regulation by law, 
      but only 22,8% had read the document. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of physicians
      and nurses on advance directives is low, so it is necessary to improve this
      knowledge. Physicians and nurses from both levels show positive attitude towards 
      the use and usefulness and respect the contents of advance directive. The
      methodology proposed is efficient to implement in a larger study, but should
      improve the distribution and collection of questionnaires.

TI  - Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the skin.
PG  - 16
AB  - B-cell lymphomas of the skin represent a wide spectrum of disorders. We present
      the microscopic and immunohistochemical features of a primary cutaneous B-cell
      lymphoma and classify it either as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or an indolent
      follicle-center-cell lymphoma according to the updated REAL/WHO system and the
      EORTC classification respectively. The former system is widely recommended;
      nevertheless, the EORTC system is also worth considering when planning
      management, because most data on long-term outcomes are based on it and it is
      considered to offer remarkable prognostic information.

LID - 10.1155/2018/9593865 [doi]
AB  - Liver abscess is a rare but serious complication of Crohn's disease. Patients
      with Crohn's disease are at risk for pyogenic liver abscesses due to
      immunosuppressive therapy, fistulous disease, and intraabdominal abscesses.
      Inflammatory bowel disease patients are also known to have a greater prevalence
      of amebiasis compared to the rest of the population; however, a higher incidence 
      of amebic liver abscess has not been reported. We describe a case of a liver
      abscess in a patient with Crohn's disease that was initially presumed pyogenic
      but later determined to be amebic in origin. Epidemiology, clinical presentation,
      diagnosis, and treatment of amebic and pyogenic liver abscesses are discussed.

AB  - Laboratory tests were conducted in order to investigate the effects of individual
      and binary-combined commercial insecticides endosulfan, temephos, malathion and
      pirimiphos-methyl on the earthworm Eisenia andrei. The effects of individual
      insecticides were determined by measuring the activities of acetylcholinesterase 
      (AChE), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). After exposure to
      studied insecticides, dose-dependent decrease in AChE activity and dose-dependent
      increase in CAT activity was recorded. The activity of GST was without consistent
      dose-response reaction, but generally the investigated insecticides caused the
      increase in GST activity. In order to determine the effects of binary-combined
      mixtures, and interactions between the components in the mixture, the
      relationship between effective concentration of AChE inhibition for mixture and
      effective concentration of AChE inhibition for each component in the mixture was 
      investigated. The obtained results showed additive effect for mixtures
      endosulfan+malathion; endosulfan+pirimiphos-methyl; temephos+malathion and
      temephos+pirimiphos-methyl, synergistic effect for mixture endosulfan+temephos
      and in the case of mixture malathion+pirimiphos-methyl the antagonistic effect
      was indicated.

AB  - Haemorrhagic disorders like Postpartum haemorrhage and Dengue haemorrhagic fever 
      are life threatening and requires an active and efficient transfusion service
      that could provide the most appropriate blood product which could be effective in
      managing them. This would essentially require prompt identification of the
      coagulopathy so that the best available product can be given to the bleeding
      patient to correct the identified haemostatic defect which will help control the 
      bleeding. This would only be possible if the transfusion service has a laboratory
      to correctly detect the haemostatic defect and that too with an accuracy and
      precision which is ensured by a good laboratory quality assurance practices.
      These same processes are necessary for the transfusion services to ensure the
      quality of the blood products manufactured by them and that it contains adequate 
      amounts of haemostasis factors which will be good to be effective in the
      management of haemorrhagic disorders. These issues are discussed in detail
      individually in the management of postpartum haemorrhage and Dengue haemorrhagic 
      fever including when these can help in the use of rFVIIa in Dengue haemorrhagic
      fever. The requirements to ensure good-quality blood products are made available 
      for the management of these disorders and the same have also been described.

TI  - Prognostic importance of the gross classification of hepatocellular carcinoma in 
      living donor-related liver transplantation.
PG  - 261-7
LID - 10.1002/bjs.7311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gross classification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been
      reported to be a significant prognostic factor for patients with HCC undergoing
      partial hepatectomy. The present study investigated whether the gross
      classification of HCC is also a prognostic factor in living donor-related liver
      transplantation (LDLT). METHODS: Some 119 patients undergoing LDLT for HCC were
      identified retrospectively from a prospective institutional database containing
      information on all LDLTs carried out between 1996 and 2009. Patients were divided
      into three groups according to the gross classification of the largest tumour in 
      the explanted liver: type 1 HCC, single nodular type (81 patients); type 2,
      single nodular type with extranodular growth (21); and type 3, contiguous
      multinodular type (17). Clinicopathological factors and recurrence-free survival 
      rates were compared. RESULTS: Recurrence-free survival rates for the whole group 
      were 87.7 per cent at 1 year, 83.5 per cent at 3 years and 81.0 per cent at 5
      years after LDLT. Type 3 HCC was associated with large tumour size, poor
      histological grade, a high incidence of microvascular invasion and multiple
      tumours. Independent predictors of poor recurrence-free survival were
      preoperative serum level of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin exceeding 300 mAU/ml,
      microvascular invasion and type 3 HCC. CONCLUSION: The gross classification of
      HCC was an independent predictor for recurrence of HCC in patients undergoing
      LDLT.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that octanitrocubane and heptanitrocubane are two
      of the most powerful non-nuclear high-energy (HE) materials currently known. In
      this study, we suggest for consideration as new possible HE materials a series of
      nitroxycubanes, in which the hydrogen atoms on cubane have been progressively
      substituted for nitrate groups. We hypothesize that these molecules will be good 
      HE materials due to their high nitrogen content and high density, the same
      reasons nitrocubanes are good high-energy materials. In this study, we predict
      optimized geometries, vibrational frequencies, enthalpies of formation, and
      specific enthalpies of combustion. Our results indicate that the enthalpies of
      formation decrease as the number of nitrate groups increases, which is in direct 
      opposition to what calculations have shown occurs for both the nitroso and the
      nitrocubane series. Given the difficulty in synthesis of octanitrocubane,
      octanitroxycubane may still be a more viable candidate for use as a new potential
      high-energy material.

AB  - The chemical structure of the mercury-mediated T-T pair (T-Hg(I)I-T) was
      determined with (15)N NMR spectroscopy. In order to determine the chemical
      structure of the T-Hg(I)I-T pair, (15)N-(15)N J-coupling across a metal center
      (2JNN) was employed. Notably, this is the first observation of (2)J(NN) in a
      biological macromolecule (DNA duplex). This pairing mode was found to be a
      irregular metal ion-binding mode for DNA and RNA molecules, in which imino
      proton-metal exchange processes are included. Accordingly, (2)J(NN) is highly
      important for the determination of the chemical structures of metal-mediated base
      pairs.

PG  - 397-401
LID - 10.1016/j.febslet.2010.12.026 [doi]
AB  - Plant alternative oxidase (AOX) activity in isolated mitochondria is regulated by
      carboxylic acids, but reaction and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. We show 
      that activity of AOX protein purified from thermogenic Arum maculatum spadices is
      sensitive to pyruvate and glyoxylate but not succinate. Rapid, irreversible AOX
      inactivation occurs in the absence of pyruvate, whether or not duroquinol
      oxidation has been initiated, and is insensitive to duroquinone. Our data
      indicate that pyruvate stabilises an active conformation of AOX, increasing the
      population of active protein in a manner independent of reducing substrate and
      product, and are thus consistent with an exclusive effect of pyruvate on the
      enzyme's apparent V(max).

TI  - Integration of multigene panels for the diagnosis of hereditary retinal disorders
      using Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics approaches.
PG  - 15-25
AB  - In recent years, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) opened a new way for the study 
      of pathogenic mechanisms and for molecular diagnosis of inherited disorders. In
      the present work, we focused our attention on the inherited retinal dystrophies
      (IRDs), a group of specific disorders of the retina, displaying a very high
      clinical and genetic heterogeneity, whose genetic diagnosis is not easily
      feasible. It represents a paradigmatic example for the integration of clinical
      and molecular examination toward precision medicine. In this paper, we discuss
      the use of targeted NGS resequencing of selected gene panels in a cohort of
      patients affected by IRDs. We tested the hypothesis to apply a selective approach
      based on a careful clinical examination. By this approach we reached a 66%
      overall detection rate for pathogenic variants, with a 52% diagnostic yield.
      Reduction of the efforts for validation and classification of variants is a clear
      advantage for the management of genetic testing in a clinical setting.

TI  - Caterpillar Track Complexes in Template-Directed Synthesis and Correlated
      Molecular Motion.
PG  - 5445-5449
AB  - Small alterations to the structure of a star-shaped template totally change its
      mode of operation. The hexapyridyl template directs the conversion of a porphyrin
      dimer to the cyclic hexamer, but deleting one pyridine site changes the product
      to the cyclic decamer, while deleting two binding sites changes the product to
      the cyclic octamer. This surprising switch in selectivity is explained by the
      formation of 2:1 caterpillar track complexes, in which two template wheels bind
      inside the nanoring. Caterpillar track complexes can also be prepared by binding 
      the hexapyridyl template inside the 8- and 10-porphyrin nanorings. NMR exchange
      spectroscopy (EXSY) experiments show that these complexes exhibit correlated
      motion, in which the conrotatory rotation of the two template wheels is coupled
      to rotation of the nanoring track. In the case of the 10-porphyrin system, the
      correlated motion can be locked by binding palladium(II) dichloride between the
      two templates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study is to quantitatively evaluate the association
      between different interventions and abstinence rates based on network
      meta-analysis. METHOD: Following PRISMA guidelines, randomized clinical trials
      that compared different alcoholic interventions for alcohol use disorders
      associated with abstinence rates in treatment sessions or/and follow-up sessions 
      were recruited. Main data synthesis was performed by Bayesian random-effects
      network meta-analyses, and the relative ranking of interventions was estimated by
      cumulative probability P values (SUCRA). Funnel plot symmetry was used to detect 
      publication bias. Moreover, pair-wised comparison was also conducted to determine
      the statistical difference and forest plots were generated to calculate the
      differences between the groups. The Grades of Recommendations Assessment,
      Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were utilized for the recommendations
      of evidence from pairwise direct comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 137 RCTs
      containing 27,282 participants and 8 variations of psychotherapy,
      pharmacotherapy, contingency management, and brief intervention used as treatment
      interventions were included. In summary, contingency management plus
      psychotherapy was demonstrated to be effective and possessed the best rank of
      achieving the highest abstinence rate in treatment sessions (SUCRA, 0.61).
      Pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy also revealed its efficacy and was associated 
      with the highest abstinence rate in follow-up sessions (SUCRA, 0.40). More
      importantly, psychotherapy alone was demonstrated not to be associated with
      higher abstinence rates in both treatment (OR, 1.052; 95% CI, 0.907-1.220) and
      follow-up sessions (OR, 0.967; 95% CI, 0.552-1.693), yet pharmacotherapy seemed
      to be the only intervention associated with higher abstinence rates compared to
      controls in both sessions (treatment session: OR, 1.074; 95% CI, 1.002-1.152)
      (follow-up session: OR, 1.442; 95% CI, 1.094-1.900). CONCLUSIONS: Contingency
      management plus psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy were
      demonstrated to be associated with the highest abstinence rates in treatment
      sessions and follow-up sessions, respectively. However, contingency management
      and pharmacotherapy seemed to be the substantial crucial factors allowing for the
      maintenance of the highest abstinence rates in respective sessions, although we
      need more evidence for further validation.

AB  - The nature of visual mental images is a topic that has puzzled neuroscientists,
      psychologists, and philosophers alike. On the one hand, mental images might
      preserve the 3-D properties of our perceptual world. On the other hand, they
      might be akin to 2-D pictures, such as photographs, paintings, or drawings. In
      the present study, 16 observers judged where real objects (Experiment 1) or
      photographs thereof (Experiment 2) were pointing. Both experiments contained a
      perception condition and an imagery condition. In Experiment 1, there was a
      significant difference between the pointing errors in the perception and the
      imagery conditions, whereas there was no such difference in Experiment 2. In
      imagined objects, actual photographs, and imagined photographs, the direction in 
      which the objects pointed followed the observer, regardless of his or her vantage
      point. The results from this study extend the rotation effect, typically found in
      pictures, to the domain of mental imagery. We found the rotation effect in
      pictures and mental images alike, but not in direct perception of 3-D objects;
      thus, we provide evidence that mental images share main characteristics of 2-D
      pictures.

TI  - Incidence of adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency.
PG  - 17-22
LID - 10.1111/cen.12865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An adrenal crisis (AC) is a potential life-threatening event in
      patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI). This study aims to determine the
      incidence, causes, and risk factors of AC in AI. METHODS: Patients with AI
      diagnosed and treated at the University Medical Center Utrecht for the past 30
      years were identified, and all medical records were assessed by two independent
      investigators. The observed frequency of AC was determined as incidence rate,
      calculated as the number of AC divided by person-years (PY). In addition,
      precipitating factors and risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: We observed an
      incidence rate of 5.2 AC (95% CI 4.3-6.3) per 100 PY in primary adrenal
      insufficiency (PAI, a total of 111 patients), and 3.6 AC (95% CI 3.1-4.1) per 100
      PY in secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI a total of 319 patients). Patients
      with an established diagnosis of tertiary (glucocorticoid-induced) adrenal
      insufficiency (a total of 28 patients) had 15.1 AC (95% CI 11.0-19.9) per 100 PY.
      The most important risk factor was the existence of comorbidity. Gastro-enteritis
      and other infections were the most common precipitating factors for AC.
      CONCLUSION: AC still occurs relatively frequent in patients with AI, mostly
      precipitated by infections and particularly in patients with high comorbidity.
      This should be taken into account in the education and follow-up of patients with
      AI.

AB  - Patients with a bipolar disorder and currently experiencing acute mania often
      require hospitalization. We explored patient problems, desired patient outcomes, 
      and nursing interventions by individually interviewing 22 nurses. Qualitative
      content analysis gave a top five of patients problems, desired patient outcomes
      and nursing interventions, identified as most important in the interviews. We
      then conducted three focus group meetings to gain greater insight into these
      results. Intensive nursing care is needed, fine-tuning on the patient as a unique
      person is essential, taking into account the nature and severity of the manic
      symptoms of the patient.

TI  - Impaired STING Pathway in Human Osteosarcoma U2OS Cells Contributes to the Growth
      of ICP0-Null Mutant Herpes Simplex Virus.
LID - e00006-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00006-17 [doi]
AB  - Human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread pathogen, with 80% of the
      population being latently infected. To successfully evade the host, the virus has
      evolved strategies to counteract antiviral responses, including the
      gene-silencing and innate immunity machineries. The immediately early protein of 
      the virus, infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), plays a central role in these
      processes. ICP0 blocks innate immunity, and one mechanism is by degrading hostile
      factors with its intrinsic E3 ligase activity. ICP0 also functions as a
      promiscuous transactivator, and it blocks repressor complexes to enable viral
      gene transcription. For these reasons, the growth of a DeltaICP0 virus is
      impaired in most cells, except cells of the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS,
      and it is only partially impaired in cells of the human osteosarcoma cell line
      Saos-2. We found that the two human osteosarcoma cell lines that supported the
      growth of the DeltaICP0 virus failed to activate innate immune responses upon
      treatment with 2'3'-cyclic GAMP (2'3'-cGAMP), the natural agonist of STING (i.e.,
      stimulator of interferon genes) or after infection with the DeltaICP0 mutant
      virus. Innate immune responses were restored in these cells by transient
      expression of the STING protein but not after overexpression of
      interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). Restoration of STING expression resulted
      in suppression of DeltaICP0 virus gene expression and a decrease in viral yields.
      Overexpression of IFI16 also suppressed DeltaICP0 virus gene expression, albeit
      to a lesser extent than STING. These data suggest that the susceptibility of U2OS
      and Saos-2 cells to the DeltaICP0 HSV-1 is in part due to an impaired STING
      pathway.IMPORTANCE The DNA sensor STING plays pivotal role in controlling HSV-1
      infection both in cell culture and in mice. The HSV-1 genome encodes numerous
      proteins that are dedicated to combat host antiviral responses. The immediate
      early protein of the virus ICP0 plays major role in this process as it targets
      hostile host proteins for degradation with its E3 ligase activity, and it
      disrupts repressor complexes via protein-protein interaction to enable viral gene
      transcription. Therefore, the DeltaICP0 HSV-1 virus is defective for growth in
      most cells, except the human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS and Saos-2. We found
      that both cell lines that support DeltaICP0 virus infection have defects in the
      STING DNA-sensing pathway, which partially accounts for the rescue of the
      DeltaICP0 virus growth. Restoration of STING expression in these cells rescued
      innate immunity and suppressed DeltaICP0 virus infection. This study underscores 
      the importance of STING in the control of HSV-1.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Polycythemia vera (PV)-related symptoms may not be adequately
      controlled with conventional therapy. This current analysis of the RESPONSE trial
      evaluated the effects of ruxolitinib compared with standard therapy on quality of
      life (QoL) and symptoms in patients with PV who were hydroxyurea
      resistant/intolerant. METHODS: In the previously reported primary analysis,
      ruxolitinib achieved the primary composite endpoint of hematocrit control and
      >/=35% reduction in spleen volume at Week 32. The current analysis evaluated
      patient-reported outcomes using the European Organisation for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF), the Pruritus
      Symptom Impact Scale (PSIS), and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). 
      RESULTS: Compared with standard therapy, ruxolitinib was associated with greater 
      improvements in global health status/QoL, functional subscales, and individual
      symptom scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30. At Week 32, more patients in the ruxolitinib
      arm (44%) achieved a >/=10-point improvement in global health status/QoL vs.
      standard therapy (9%). Improvements in MPN-SAF symptom scores were consistent
      with improvements in EORTC QLQ-C30, PSIS, and PGIC scores. CONCLUSIONS:
      Ruxolitinib provides clinically relevant improvements in QoL and ameliorates
      symptom burden in patients with PV who are hydroxyurea resistant/intolerant.

TI  - A novel retractable laparoscopic device for mapping gastrointestinal slow wave
      propagation patterns.
PG  - 477-486
LID - 10.1007/s00464-016-4936-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric slow waves regulate peristalsis, and gastric dysrhythmias
      have been implicated in functional motility disorders. To accurately define slow 
      wave patterns, it is currently necessary to collect high-resolution serosal
      recordings during open surgery. We therefore developed a novel gastric slow wave 
      mapping device for use during laparoscopic procedures. METHODS: The device
      consists of a retractable catheter constructed of a flexible nitinol core coated 
      with Pebax. Once deployed through a 5-mm laparoscopic port, the spiral head is
      revealed with 32 electrodes at 5 mm intervals. Recordings were validated against 
      a reference electrode array in pigs and tested in a human patient. RESULTS:
      Recordings from the device and a reference array in pigs were identical in
      frequency (2.6 cycles per minute; p = 0.91), and activation patterns and
      velocities were consistent (8.9 +/- 0.2 vs 8.7 +/- 0.1 mm s(-1); p = 0.2). Device
      and reference amplitudes were comparable (1.3 +/- 0.1 vs 1.4 +/- 0.1 mV; p =
      0.4), though the device signal-to-noise ratio was higher (17.5 +/- 0.6 vs 12.8
      +/- 0.6 dB; P < 0.0001). In the human patient, corpus slow waves were recorded
      and mapped (frequency 2.7 +/- 0.03 cycles per minute, amplitude 0.8 +/- 0.4 mV,
      velocity 2.3 +/- 0.9 mm s(-1)). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the novel laparoscopic
      device achieves high-quality serosal slow wave recordings. It can be used for
      laparoscopic diagnostic studies to document slow wave patterns in patients with
      gastric motility disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most frequent nervous system complications of multiple myeloma
      are peripheral neuropathy and epidural spinal cord compression. Myelomatous
      meningitis (MM) has been considered rare. The current study was performed to
      characterize the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of MM. METHODS:
      The study was a case series of 14 patients with cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF)-positive MM who were treated at a tertiary care university medical center. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen patients with advanced multiple myeloma were treated with
      involved-field radiotherapy (to the brain in 5 patients and the spine in 6
      patients) and intra-CSF chemotherapy (ventricular in 10 patients and lumbar in 4 
      patients). The best response to treatment included 6 partial responses and 8
      patients with progressive disease. The median duration of response was 2.5 months
      (range, 0-6 months). Cause of death was progressive neurologic disease in 6
      patients, combined systemic and neurologic disease in 6 patients, and systemic
      disease progression in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MM is rare and morbid entity
      (6-month neurologic disease progression-free survival rate of 7%), and appears to
      be no more responsive to treatment than solid tumor carcinomatous meningitis.

AB  - Eduardo Primo Yufera was the founder and director of the Instituto de Agroquimica
      y Tecnologia de Alimentos (IATA, 1957-1974) until he was appointed president of
      the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC). His aim to publicize 
      food science led him to create the Revista de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de
      Alimentos in 1961, the forerunner of this journal, Food Science and Technology
      International, which he directed until 1977. Of his scientific output, 50% has
      been published in this journal. He is considered to be the promoter and exponent 
      of Food Science and Technology and Chemical Ecology in Spain as well as the
      instigator of the country's innovation model (R&D and innovation). In his work,
      he was able to combine basic research excellence and socially relevant applied
      research to move both science and society forward. He was an example and
      inspiration to many colleagues and followers. The aim of this study is to
      highlight the influence and importance of Primo Yufera in the formation,
      development and consolidation of the journal Revista de Agroquimica y Tecnologia 
      de Alimentos, and to appraise his scientific contribution to this journal.

TI  - Importance of lipid levels in elderly diabetic individuals: baseline
      characteristics and 1-year survey of cardiovascular events.
PG  - 218-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The respective incidences of ischemic heart and cerebrovascular
      disease (IHD, CVD) are high in diabetic individuals. Complications of
      dyslipidemia increase the risk, but direct evidence is limited, so a cohort
      prospective study (Japan-CDM) was conducted. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group
      comprised 4,014 subjects with type 2 diabetes (1,936 women, 2,078 men; mean age
      67.4+/-9.5 years) who were divided into dyslipidemic patients (79.1%) with or
      without medication (medicated, 50.9%; not medicated, 28.2%) and normo-lipidemic
      patients (20.9%). The incidence of IHD, CVD, arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO),
      congestive heart failure (CHF) and death was assessed. IHD and CVD occurred in
      0.82 and 0.67%, respectively, during the first year following registration. CHF, 
      ASO and sudden death occurred in 0.27%, 0.12% and 0.12%, respectively. There was 
      a significant statistical difference in the relation of elevated levels of
      high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol to lower rates of IHD and CVD. IHD and CVD
      in males were dependent on the level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
      (LDL-C): 0.45%, 1.56%, 1.78%, 1.91% and 2.34% were observed in less than 2.11,
      2.11-2.62, 2.63-3.15, 3.16-3.67, and more than 3.68 mol/L of LDL-C. In the lowest
      LDL-C group, death other than from vascular diseases was increased. Age, sex
      (male) and complicated hypertension increased the risk of events. Patients who
      were prescribed antihyperlipidemic agents suffered less events than patients who 
      were not being treated, which suggests direct effects of therapy. CONCLUSION:
      Strict lipid control may be effective for reducing the incidence of vascular
      events in Japanese diabetic individuals.

AB  - Water may influence the mechanical properties of the acrylic resins. Thus, the
      effect of water storage on the impact strength (IS) of one denture base (Lucitone
      550 - L) and four reline resins (Tokuyama Rebase II - T; UfiGel Hard - U;
      Kooliner - K; New Truliner - NT) was evaluated. Bars of L were made (60 x 6 x 2
      mm) and relined (2 mm) with T, U, K, NT and L. Intact specimens of each material 
      (60 x 6 x 4 mm) were also fabricated for comparative purposes. Specimens were
      submitted to Charpy impact tests without water storage (control) and after
      immersion in water for 7, 90 and 180 days. Data (kJ/m(2)) analyzed by two-way
      ANOVA and Tukey's test (p=0.05) revealed that after 90 days, U exhibited an
      increase in the IS (0.93) compared to 7 days (0.58). K (1.48) and L/K (7.21)
      exhibited a decrease at the 7-day period (1.01 and 3.23, respectively). NT (0.60)
      showed an increase in the IS after 180 days (1.52), whereas L/NT (7.70) showed a 
      decrease (3.17). Water immersion improved the IS of U and NT, and decreased the
      IS of K, L/K, and L/NT. Water may affect differently the IS of acrylic resins
      and, consequently, the resistance to fracture of relined denture bases.

TI  - On the equivalence of Goodman's and Hempel's paradoxes.
PG  - 32-42
AB  - Historically, Nelson Goodman's paradox involving the predicates 'grue' and
      'bleen' has been taken to furnish a serious blow to Carl Hempel's theory of
      confirmation in particular and to purely formal theories of confirmation in
      general. In this paper, I argue that Goodman's paradox is no more serious of a
      threat to Hempel's theory of confirmation than is Hempel's own paradox of the
      ravens. I proceed by developing a suggestion from R. D. Rosenkrantz into an
      argument for the conclusion that these paradoxes are, in fact, equivalent. My
      argument, if successful, is of both historical and philosophical interest.
      Goodman himself maintained that Hempel's theory of confirmation was capable of
      handling the paradox of the ravens. And Hempel eventually conceded that Goodman's
      paradox showed that there could be no adequate, purely syntactical theory of
      confirmation. The conclusion of my argument entails, by contrast, that Hempel's
      theory of confirmation is incapable of handling Goodman's paradox if and only if 
      it is incapable of handling the paradox of the ravens. It also entails that for
      any adequate solution to one of these paradoxes, there is a corresponding and
      equally adequate solution to the other.

TI  - Why cannot a beta-lactamase gene be detected using an efficient molecular
      diagnostic method?
PG  - 1309-1311
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fast detection of beta-lactamase (bla) genes can minimize the spread
      of antibiotic resistance. Although several molecular diagnostic methods have been
      developed to detect limited bla gene types, these methods have significant
      limitations, such as their failure to detect almost all clinically available bla 
      genes. We have evaluated a further refinement of our fast and accurate molecular 
      method, developed to overcome these limitations, using clinical isolates.
      METHODS: We have recently developed the efficient large-scale bla detection
      method (large-scaleblaFinder) that can detect bla gene types including almost all
      clinically available 1,352 bla genes with perfect specificity and sensitivity.
      Using this method, we have evaluated a further refinement of this method using
      clinical isolates provided by International Health Management Associates, Inc.
      (Schaumburg, Illinois, USA). Results were interpreted in a blinded manner by
      researchers who did not know any information on bla genes harbored by these
      isolates. RESULTS: With only one exception, the large-scaleblaFinder detected all
      bla genes identified by the provider using microarray and multiplex PCR. In one
      of the Escherichia coli test isolates, a blaDHA-1 gene was detected using the
      multiplex PCR assay but it was not detected using the large-scaleblaFinder.
      CONCLUSION: The truncation of a blaDHA-1 gene is an important reason for an
      efficient molecular diagnostic method (large-scaleblaFinder) not to detect the
      bla gene.

      characteristics from neural data.
PG  - e0202561
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0202561 [doi]
AB  - We develop of a line of work initiated by Curto and Itskov towards understanding 
      the amount of information contained in the spike trains of hippocampal place
      cells via topology considerations. Previously, it was established that simply
      knowing which groups of place cells fire together in an animal's hippocampus is
      sufficient to extract the global topology of the animal's physical environment.
      We model a system where collections of place cells group and ungroup according to
      short-term plasticity rules. In particular, we obtain the surprising result that 
      in experiments with spurious firing, the accuracy of the extracted topological
      information decreases with the persistence (beyond a certain regime) of the cell 
      groups. This suggests that synaptic transience, or forgetting, is a mechanism by 
      which the brain counteracts the effects of spurious place cell activity.

      water temperature, salinity and light-dark cycle.
PG  - 121-9
LID - 10.1080/08927014.2012.654779 [doi]
AB  - The quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussel (Dreissena
      polymorpha) are invasive freshwater bivalves in Europe and North America. The
      distribution range of both Dreissena species is still expanding and both species 
      cause major biofouling and ecological effects, in particular when they invade new
      areas. In order to assess the effect of temperature, salinity and light on the
      initial byssogenesis of both species, 24 h re-attachment experiments in standing 
      water were conducted. At a water temperature of 25 degrees C and a salinity of
      0.2 psu, the rate of byssogenesis of D. polymorpha was significantly higher than 
      that of D. rostriformis bugensis. In addition, byssal thread production by the
      latter levelled out between 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The rate of
      byssogenesis at temperatures<25 degrees C was similar for both species. Neither
      species produced any byssal threads at salinities of 4 psu or higher. At a
      salinity of 1 psu and a water temperature of 15 degrees C, D. polymorpha produced
      significantly more byssal threads than D. rostriformis bugensis. There was no
      significant effect of the length of illumination on the byssogenesis of either
      species. Overall, D. polymorpha produced slightly more byssal threads than D.
      rostriformis bugensis at almost all experimental conditions in 24 h re-attachment
      experiments, but both species had essentially similar initial re-attachment
      abilities. The data imply that D. rostriformis bugensis causes biofouling
      problems identical to those of D. polymorpha.

TI  - Kinetics of the solvolyses of benzhydryl derivatives: basis for the construction 
      of a comprehensive nucleofugality scale.
PG  - 1648-56
AB  - A series of 21 benzhydrylium ions (diarylmethylium ions) are proposed as
      reference electrofuges for the development of a general nucleofugality scale,
      where nucleofugality refers to a combination of leaving group and solvent. A
      total of 167 solvolysis rate constants of benzhydrylium tosylates, bromides,
      chlorides, trifluoroacetates, 3,5-dinitrobenzoates, and 4-nitrobenzoates,
      two-thirds of which have been determined during this work, were subjected to a
      least-squares fit according to the correlation equation log k(25 degrees C) =
      sf(Nf + Ef), where sf and Nf are nucleofuge-specific parameters and Ef is an
      electrofuge-specific parameter. Although nucleofuges and electrofuges
      characterized in this way cover more than 12 orders of magnitude, a single set of
      the parameters, namely sf, Nf, and Ef, is sufficient to calculate the solvolysis 
      rate constants at 25 degrees C with an accuracy of +/-16 %. Because sf
      approximately 1 for all nucleofuges, that is, leaving group/solvent combinations,
      studied so far, qualitative discussions of nucleofugality can be based on Nf.

LID - 10.1037/emo0000236 [doi]
AB  - We report 2 studies on how residents of Papua New Guinea interpret facial
      expressions produced spontaneously by other residents of Papua New Guinea.
      Members of a small-scale indigenous society, Trobrianders (Milne Bay Province; N 
      = 32, 14 to 17 years) were shown 5 facial expressions spontaneously produced by
      members of another small-scale indigenous society, Fore (Eastern Highlands
      Province) that Ekman had photographed, labeled, and published in The Face of Man 
      (1980), each as an expression of a basic emotion: happiness, sadness, anger,
      surprise, and disgust. Trobrianders were asked to use any word they wanted to
      describe how each person shown felt and to provide valence and arousal ratings.
      Other Trobrianders (N = 24, 12 to 14 years) were shown the same photographs but
      asked to choose their response from a short list. In both studies, agreement with
      Ekman's predicted labels was low: 0% to 16% and 13% to 38% of observers,
      respectively. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of phototherapy in the United States declined during the 1990s,
      largely due to unfavorable economic incentives. The trends in phototherapy since 
      then are not well characterized. METHODS: We analyzed the National Ambulatory
      Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data on quantity of phototherapy visits and
      associated diagnoses and payment sources. Trends were assessed by linear
      regression. RESULTS: There were an estimated 230 000 outpatient phototherapy
      visits per year, with an increasing trend over time (p = 0.03). Dermatologists
      managed 87% of the visits. Leading diagnoses associated with phototherapy
      included psoriasis (25%), dermatitis NOS (6%), vitiligo (6%), other dyschromia
      (6%), and actinic keratosis (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of phototherapy for psoriasis 
      has remained relatively low up to 2010. However, phototherapy may be becoming
      more frequent for conditions other than psoriasis.

TI  - Differential role of cathepsins B and L in autophagy-associated cell death
      induced by arsenic trioxide in U87 human glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 519-31
LID - 10.1515/BC.2010.050 [doi]
AB  - Arsenic trioxide (arsenite) was the first chemotherapeutic drug to be described
      and is now being rediscovered in cancer treatment, including glioblastoma
      multiforme. Arsenite toxicity triggers autophagy in cancer cells, although final 
      stages of the process involve executive caspases, suggesting an interplay between
      autophagic and apoptotic pathways that awaits to be explained at a molecular
      level. We evaluated the contribution of the lysosomal cathepsins (Cat) L and B,
      which are upregulated in glioblastomas, in the mechanism of arsenite toxicity in 
      human glioblastoma cells. Arsenite treatment induced autophagosome formation and 
      permeabilization of mitochondria, followed by caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis. The
      autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine protected from arsenite toxicity, whereas
      bafilomycin A1 did not. Furthermore, arsenite significantly decreased CatB levels
      and selectively inhibited its cellular and recombinant protein activity, while
      not affecting CatL. However, downregulation of CatL greatly enhanced apoptosis by
      arsenite. Our results show that arsenite toxicity involves a complex interplay
      between autophagy and apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells and is associated
      with inhibition of CatB, and that this toxicity is highly exacerbated by
      simultaneous CatL inhibition. The latter points to a synergy that could be used
      in clinical treatment to lower the therapeutic dose, thus avoiding the toxic side
      effects of arsenite in glioblastoma management.

TI  - A New Health Care Prevention Agenda: Sustainable Food Procurement and
      Agricultural Policy.
PG  - 409-429
AB  - Health care leaders are broadening their awareness to include the need to address
      the food system as a means to individual, public, and global health, above and
      beyond basic nutritional factors. Key voices from the health care sector have
      begun to engage in market transformation and are aggregating to articulate the
      urgency for engagement in food and agricultural policy. Systemic transformation
      requires a range of policies that complement one another and address various
      aspects of the food system. Health care involvement in policy and advocacy is
      vital to solve the expanding ecological health crises facing our nation and globe
      and will require an urgency that may be unprecedented.

TI  - Design of a device for sky light polarization measurements.
PG  - 14916-31
LID - 10.3390/s140814916 [doi]
AB  - Sky polarization patterns can be used both as indicators of atmospheric turbidity
      and as a sun compass for navigation. The objective of this study is to improve
      the precision of sky light polarization measurements by optimal design of the
      device used. The central part of the system is composed of a Charge Coupled
      Device (CCD) camera; a fish-eye lens and a linear polarizer. Algorithms for
      estimating parameters of the polarized light based on three images are derived
      and the optimal alignments of the polarizer are analyzed. The least-squares
      estimation is introduced for sky light polarization pattern measurement. The
      polarization patterns of sky light are obtained using the designed system and
      they follow almost the same patterns of the single-scattering Rayleigh model.
      Deviations of polarization angles between observation and the theory are
      analyzed. The largest deviations occur near the sun and anti-sun directions.
      Ninety percent of the deviations are less than 5 degrees and 40% percent of them 
      are less than 1 degrees . The deviations decrease evidently as the degree of
      polarization increases. It also shows that the polarization pattern of the cloudy
      sky is almost identical as in the blue sky.

TI  - Electron spin resonance shift and linewidth broadening of nitrogen-vacancy
      centers in diamond as a function of electron irradiation dose.
PG  - 82410
AB  - A high-nitrogen-concentration diamond sample was subjected to 200-keV electron
      irradiation using a transmission electron microscope. The optical and
      spin-resonance properties of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers were
      investigated as a function of the irradiation dose up to 6.4 x 10(21) e(-)/cm(2).
      The microwave transition frequency of the NV(-) center was found to shift by up
      to 0.6% (17.1 MHz) and the linewidth broadened with increasing
      electron-irradiation dose. Unexpectedly, the measured magnetic sensitivity is
      best at the lowest irradiation dose, even though the NV concentration increases
      monotonically with increasing dose. This is in large part due to a sharp
      reduction in optically detected spin contrast at higher doses.

TI  - Efficacy of exposure-based cognitive behaviour therapy for post-traumatic stress 
      disorder in emergency service personnel: a randomised clinical trial.
PG  - 1565-1573
LID - 10.1017/S0033291718002234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although emergency service personnel experience markedly elevated the
      rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there are no rigorously conducted
      trials for PTSD in this population. This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive
      behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if 
      brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged
      exposure (CBT-L). METHOD: One hundred emergency service personnel with PTSD were 
      randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL). Following
      post-treatment assessment, WL participants were randomised to an active
      treatment. Participants randomised to CBT-L or CBT-B were assessed at baseline,
      post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Both CBT conditions involved 12 weekly
      individual sessions comprising education, CBT skills building, imaginal exposure,
      in vivo exposure, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention. Imaginal
      exposure occurred for 40 min per session in CBT-L and for 10 min in CBT-B.
      RESULTS: At post-treatment, participants in WL had smaller reductions in PTSD
      severity (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale), depression, maladaptive appraisals 
      about oneself and the world, and smaller improvements on psychological and social
      quality of life than CBT-L and CBT-B. There were no differences between CBT-L and
      CBT-B at follow-up on primary or secondary outcome measures but both CBT-L and
      CBT-B had large baseline to follow-up effect sizes for reduction of PTSD
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that CBT, which can include either
      long or brief imaginal exposure, is efficacious in reducing PTSD in emergency
      service personnel.

TI  - Gene induction following wounding of wild-type versus macrophage-deficient
      Drosophila embryos.
PG  - 465-71
LID - 10.1038/embor.2008.34 [doi]
AB  - By using a microarray screen to compare gene responses after sterile laser
      wounding of wild-type and 'macrophageless' serpent mutant Drosophila embryos, we 
      show the wound-induced programmes that are independent of a pathogenic response
      and distinguish which of the genes are macrophage dependent. The evolutionarily
      conserved nature of this response is highlighted by our finding that one such new
      inflammation-associated gene, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45
      (GADD45), is upregulated in both Drosophila and murine repair models. Comparison 
      of unwounded wild-type and serpent mutant embryos also shows a portfolio of
      'macrophage-specific' genes, which suggest analogous functions with vertebrate
      inflammatory cells. Besides identifying the various classes of wound- and
      macrophage-related genes, our data indicate that sterile injury per se, in the
      absence of pathogens, triggers induction of a 'pathogen response', which might
      prime the organism for what is likely to be an increased risk of infection.

TI  - Aortic neck dilation is not associated with adverse outcomes after fenestrated
      endovascular aneurysm repair.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Long-term outcomes after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are
      threatened by aortic neck dilation (AND), graft migration, and subsequent
      endoleak development. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of AND and 
      the occurrence of endoleaks after fenestrated EVAR of juxtarenal aneurysms with
      physician-modified endovascular grafts (PMEGs). METHODS: The study included 77
      patients presenting with asymptomatic and ruptured juxtarenal abdominal aortic
      aneurysms treated with PMEGs who received radiologic follow-up. Analysis of
      computed tomography images took place on a three-dimensional workstation
      (TeraRecon, San Mateo, Calif). Aortic neck diameter was measured before and after
      EVAR at the lowest patent renal artery outer wall to outer wall. Significant AND 
      was defined as >3-mm increase between baseline and follow-up, and sac regression 
      >5 mm was considered significant. The patient's 1-month initial postoperative
      computed tomography measurement was considered baseline. The rate of AND was
      measured by comparing the baseline measurement with measurements at 6 months, 12 
      months, and annually thereafter up to 4 years. RESULTS: In this cohort of
      patients, 75% were men with a mean age of 74 +/- 7.9 years. Median preoperative
      aneurysm size was 62 (57-73) mm, and median follow-up was 12 (3.5-30) months.
      Mean endograft oversizing was 17% +/- 12.5%, and mean seal zone length was 41 +/-
      11 mm. At 1-year follow-up, the median aortic neck increase was 1.7 (0-3) mm.
      Maximum aneurysm size decreased dramatically during the first postoperative year,
      with significant sac regression in 65% of the patients. Aortic neck diameter at 1
      year did correlate positively with the percentage of device oversizing. No other 
      correlations were found. During the 4-year follow-up, there were no cases of type
      IA endoleaks. CONCLUSIONS: AND does not influence outcome after endovascular
      repair of juxtarenal aneurysms using PMEGs. These midterm results support the
      applicability of PMEGs in juxtarenal aneurysm repair.

TI  - Genetic diversity of the sunflower caterpillar (Chlosyne lacinia saundersii
      Doubleday and Hewitson) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) populations determined by
      molecular RAPD markers.
PG  - 1127-36
LID - S0001-37652010000400029 [pii]
AB  - Chlosyne lacinia saundersii is one of the most important pests of sunflower and
      it is the main target of insecticides applications. Larvae were collected in
      Londrina (PR), Santa Maria (RS), Dourados (MS), Ribeirao Preto (SP), Brasilia
      (DF), Barreiras (BA), Uberaba (MG) and Vilhena (RO). Genomic DNA was extracted
      and amplified with ten-mer primers, which produced 101 loci. The size of the RAPD
      amplicons ranged from 180 to 2564 bp. Polymorphism among populations ranged from 
      31% to 67%, with the highest polymorphisms of 57% and 67% being detected in
      Uberaba and Vilhena populations, respectively. Populations with the highest
      similarity determined with Dice coefficient were from Ribeirao Preto and
      Barreiras, while insects from Londrina showed the highest similarity among them. 
      Gene flow of C. lacinia saundersii 1.1 was lower than those previously observed
      for the noctuid Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, suggesting that C. lacinia
      saundersii populations are more isolated than the ones of this noctuid. Through
      the Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), RAPD variance was 33.64% among
      geographical populations and 66.36% within populations. These results suggest
      that populations of C. lacinia saundersii are genetically structured.

TI  - Students' perceptions of their education on graduation from a dental school in
      India.
PG  - 1520-6
AB  - This study was conducted with the purpose of assessing students' perceived
      learning experience at the time of graduation from a dental school in India. The 
      domains appraised were undergraduate curriculum, student motivation and support
      services, institutional infrastructure, administrative services, components of
      teaching-learning programs, confidence level in carrying out specific clinical
      procedures, career choice, and postgraduate specialty preference after
      graduation. The authors surveyed forty-five dental interns at the end of their
      undergraduate course, a 100 percent response rate from the class. The results
      showed that over 95 percent of the graduates were satisfied with the curriculum
      and 60 to 95 percent reported that the various components of the
      teaching-learning process were adequate. Only 42 percent of the students were
      confident about setting up a practice; 65 percent wished to take a course on
      general dentistry; and 86 percent wanted to pursue postgraduate study. The
      principal conclusions were that although the program was satisfactory to the
      majority of participants, some areas of concern were identified that need
      improvement.

TI  - Transient posttransplant graft-versus-host lymphadenopathy.
PG  - 533-7
AB  - There is sparse information in humans on graft-versus-host (GVH) lymphadenopathy.
      A 15-month-old male received a liver and small bowel transplant for short bowel
      after gastroschisis. At 21 days he developed a GVH-like skin rash. Flow cytometry
      demonstrated 16.1% circulating donor cells. Polymerase chain reaction for
      Epstein-Barr virus was negative. Two months later, the rash recurred with diffuse
      lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy showed effaced architecture without visible
      follicles, large numbers of CD79a(+) immunoblasts interspersed with smaller
      CD3(+) and CD8(+) cells, and prominent dendritic cell hyperplasia. Human herpes
      virus 8, cytomegalovirus, and EBER-1 probes were negative, as was polymerase
      chain reaction for human herpes virus 6. Allograft intestinal biopsies on days 10
      and 24 had a similar infiltrate. The features appeared to be those of lymphocytes
      trafficking between the graft and host with a mixed lymphocyte reaction in situ, 
      a GVH-type reaction without tissue damage. The reaction was self-limiting in the 
      intestinal graft, and the lymphadenopathy resolved with some decrease in
      immunosupression. Circulating donor cells fell to 2.5% by day 62, and the child
      has been rejection free on low-dose immunosuppression.

AB  - Celiac sprue is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine caused by dietary 
      gluten and treated by adherence to a life-long gluten-free diet. The recent
      identification of immunodominant gluten peptides, the discovery of their cogent
      properties, and the elucidation of the mechanisms by which they engender
      immunopathology in genetically susceptible individuals have advanced our
      understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this complex disease, enabling the
      rational design of new therapeutic strategies. The most clinically advanced of
      these is oral enzyme therapy, in which enzymes capable of proteolyzing gluten
      (i.e., glutenases) are delivered to the alimentary tract of a celiac sprue
      patient to detoxify ingested gluten in situ. In this chapter, we discuss the key 
      challenges for discovery and preclinical development of oral enzyme therapies for
      celiac sprue. Methods for lead identification, assay development, gram-scale
      production and formulation, and lead optimization for next-generation proteases
      are described and critically assessed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of
      furosemide in cats following intravenous (IV), oral and transdermal
      administration. METHODS: This study used six healthy adult cats in a three-phase 
      design to compare plasma furosemide concentrations in cats that received one IV 2
      mg/kg dose of furosemide, one oral 2 mg/kg dose of furosemide and 3 days of q12h 
      dosing with 2 mg/kg furosemide transdermally applied to the ear pinna. RESULTS:
      After IV administration the elimination half-life was (mean and coefficient of
      variation) 2.25 h (72%), systemic clearance was 149 ml/kg/h (27.4%) and volume of
      distribution was 227 ml/kg (22%). After oral administration the terminal
      half-life was 1.2 h (18.7%), peak concentration was 3.4 mug/ml (51.7%) and
      bioavailability was 48.4%. The transdermal plasma concentrations were
      undetectable or very low at most time points, and pharmacokinetics were not
      determined from the transdermal dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Furosemide was
      rapidly eliminated in cats after oral and IV administration and is probably best 
      administered orally at least q12h in cats with heart failure. The oral dose
      absorbed was approximately 50%, but the absorption from transdermal
      administration was negligible.

TI  - Technology in Paralympic sport: performance enhancement or essential for
      performance?
PG  - 215-20
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.067249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with disabilities often depend on assistive devices to enable 
      activities of daily living as well as to compete in sport. Technological
      developments in sport can be controversial. OBJECTIVES: To review, identify and
      describe current technological developments in assistive devices used in the
      summer Paralympic Games; and to prepare for the London 2012 Games, the future
      challenges and the role of technology are debated. METHODS: A systematic review
      of the peer-reviewed literature and personal observations of technological
      developments at the Athens (2004) and Beijing (2008) Paralympic Games was
      conducted. RESULTS: Standard assistive devices can inhibit the Paralympians'
      abilities to perform the strenuous activities of their sports. Although many
      Paralympic sports only require technology similar to their Olympic counterparts, 
      several unique technological modifications have been made in prosthetic and
      wheelchair devices. Technology is essential for the Paralympic athlete, and the
      potential technological advantage for a Paralympian, when competing against an
      Olympian, is unclear. CONCLUSION: Technology must match the individual
      requirements of the athlete with the sport in order for Paralympians to safely
      maximise their performance. Within the 'performance enhancement or essential for 
      performance?' debate, any potential increase in mechanical performance from an
      assistive device must be considered holistically with the compensatory
      consequences the disability creates. To avoid potential technology controversies 
      at the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, the role of technology in sport 
      must be clarified.

TI  - 135G/C polymorphism in the RAD51 gene and acute myeloid leukemia risk: a
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.4238/gmr.15027383 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies have evaluated the association between the 135G/C polymorphism
      in the RAD51 gene and risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the results have 
      been inconsistent. The aim of this study is to precisely examine the association 
      between the 135G/C polymorphism in the RAD51 gene and AML risk through a
      meta-analysis. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were
      systematically searched to identify relevant studies from their inception to June
      2015. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were
      calculated using fixed- or random-effect models. A total of 6 case-control
      studies containing 1432 patients and 2750 controls were used in this
      meta-analysis, and our results showed no association between the 135G/C
      polymorphism in the RAD51 gene and AML risk (CC vs GG: OR = 1.67, 95%CI =
      0.93-3.02; GC vs GG: OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 0.80-1.92; the dominant model: OR = 1.26,
      95%CI = 0.83-1.91; the recessive model: OR = 1.63, 95%CI = 0.90-2.95). No
      publication bias was found in this study. In summary, the present meta-analysis
      suggests that the 135G/C polymorphism in the RAD51 gene may not be associated
      with AML risk. However, further studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm
      this conclusion.

TI  - An increasing trend of rural infections of human influenza A (H7N9) from 2013 to 
      2017: A retrospective analysis of patient exposure histories in Zhejiang
      province, China.
PG  - e0193052
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0193052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although investigations have shown that closing live poultry markets 
      (LPMs) is highly effective in controlling human influenza A (H7N9) infections,
      many of the urban LPMs were shut down, but rural LPMs remained open. This study
      aimed to compare the proportional changes between urban and rural infections in
      the Zhejiang province from 2013 to 2017 by analyzing the exposure histories of
      human cases. METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 from 2013 (the first
      wave) to 2017 (the fifth wave) in the Zhejiang province of China were analyzed.
      Urban and rural infections were defined based on the locations of poultry
      exposure (direct and indirect) in urban areas (central towns) and rural areas
      (towns and villages on the outskirts of cities). A Chi-square trend test was used
      to compare the proportional trend between urban and rural infections over time
      and logistic regression was used to obtain the odds ratio by years. RESULTS: From
      2013 to 2017, a statistically significant trend in rural infections was observed 
      (p <0.01). The incremental odds ratio by years of rural infections was 1.59 with 
      95% confidence intervals of 1.34 to 1.86. Each year, significant increases in the
      proportion of live poultry transactions in LPMS and poultry processing plants
      were detected in conjunction with an increased proportion of urban and rural
      infections. CONCLUSION: The empirical evidence indicated a need for heightened
      infection control measures in rural areas, such as serving rural farms and
      backyards as active surveillance points for the H7N9 virus. Other potential
      interventions such as the vaccination of poultry and extending the closure of
      LPMs to the provincial level require further careful investigations.

TI  - Tailored flow alteration treatment for intracranial internal carotid artery
      aneurysms: strategy beyond parent artery occlusion with bypass. Case report.
PG  - 213-6
AB  - A 58-year-old woman with multiple right internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms
      detected incidentally was referred to us. Three-dimensional computed tomography
      (CT) angiography revealed a broad-necked paraclinoid aneurysm and an aneurysm on 
      the C(1) segment. Aneurysm clipping with preservation of the anterior choroidal
      artery and posterior communicating artery was not possible because these vessels 
      could not be adequately identified. Intraoperative digital subtraction
      angiography during obliteration of the cervical portion of the ICA confirmed
      retrograde flow from the extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass to the right
      ophthalmic artery and stagnation of flow in the aneurysms. The cervical portion
      of the ICA was ligated. Postoperative three-dimensional CT angiography confirmed 
      complete occlusion of both aneurysms and absence of ischemic lesions involving
      branches of the ICA. Reversal of the blood flow in the ICA via the EC-IC bypass
      primarily into the ophthalmic artery as the flow outlet by obliterating the
      cervical portion of the ICA was successful. To prevent ischemia in the territory 
      fed by the perforating arteries of the ICA, tailored flow alteration treatment
      may be superior to simple parent artery occlusion of the ICA with/without bypass.
      The pattern of flow alteration should be deliberately based on individual
      anatomic variations, especially the preservation of flow outlets.

PG  - 142-7, 159; quiz 148
AB  - The number of new graduates who will be needed to fill positions in our
      acute-care hospitals is astounding. The hiring and precepting of this many
      inexperienced nurses will severely tax hospital resources. A sound plan must be
      developed to maintain quality of care and patient safety with the influx of so
      many new nurse graduates. New graduates also must have a positive learning
      experience in order to keep them in the nursing workforce. A residency program is
      essential for new graduates. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must 
      step to the plate and support accredited nurse residency programs with
      pass-through dollars.

TI  - MiR-133b is frequently decreased in gastric cancer and its overexpression reduces
      the metastatic potential of gastric cancer cells.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-14-34 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs are involved in gastric
      cancer development and progression. Here we examine the role of miR-133b in
      gastric cancer. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed in 140
      patient gastric cancer tissues and 8 gastric cancer cell lines. The effects of
      miR-133b in gastric cancer cells metastasis were examined by scratch assay,
      transwell migration and matrigel invasion. In vivo effects of miR-133b were
      examined in an intraperitoneal mouse tumor model. Targets of miR-133b were
      predicted by bioinformatics tools and validated by luciferase reporter analyses, 
      western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: MiR-133b was significantly
      downregulated in 70% (98/140) of gastric cancer patients. Expression of miR-133b 
      was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer in
      patients. Similarly, the expression of miR-133b was significantly lower in seven 
      tested gastric cancer cell lines than in the immortalized non-cancerous GES-1
      gastric epithelial cells. Overexpression of miR-133b markedly inhibited
      metastasis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the
      transcriptional factor Gli1 was identified as a direct target for miR-133b. Level
      of Gli1 protein but not mRNA was decreased by miR-133b. Activity of luciferase
      with Gli1 3'-untranslated region was markedly decreased by miR-133b in gastric
      cancer cells. Gli1 target genes, OPN and Zeb2, were also inhibited by miR133b.
      CONCLUSIONS: MiR-133b is frequently decreased in gastric cancer. Overexpression
      of miR-133b inhibits cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo partly by directly
      suppressing expression of Gli1 protein. These results suggested that miR-133b
      plays an important role in gastric cancer metastasis.

AB  - Calculation of design drainage modulus is of great importance for the safety of
      farmland and reduction of waterlogging loss. We investigated the effects of main 
      meteorological factors on design farmland drainage modulus by focusing on a
      closed farmland area in Ninghe District of Tianjin City. To resolve the problem
      of limited observation, the parameter sensitivity was analyzed according to
      mutual information and partial rank correlation coefficient aiming at the total
      runoff depth based on field observation experiment. The reasonable parameters
      were obtained by combining with soil water content and the relative variation of 
      groundwater level. Then, a three-source runoff yield model coupling of excess
      infiltration and saturation was established to estimate runoff and design
      drainage modulus, and the effects of meteorological factors such as precipitation
      and evaporation on drainage modulus were analyzed. Results showed that summer
      precipitation significantly reduced and evaporation varied a little during
      1960-2015. The corresponding drainage modulus decreased with the reduction of
      precipitation. When return period increased, the magnitude of the reduction in
      precipitation as well as the design drainage modulus increased. However, the
      effects of meteorological factors on design drainage modulus was generally
      inapparent. Thus, we concluded that the current drainage modulus is suitable for 
      the study area.

AB  - In a prospective cohort study, the daily bodyweight (BW) and milk production of
      92 cows were recorded using automatic milking systems. The objectives were to
      characterize calcium serum concentration variability on days 1-3 post-partum and 
      to evaluate the association between subclinical hypocalcemia (SHPC) and change in
      BW over the first 30 days in milk (DIM) in Holstein dairy cows, while controlling
      for concurrent disease and negative energy balance (NEB). SHPC was defined as
      total serum calcium concentration between 6 and 8 mg/dL, NEB was defined as
      non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) > 0.7 mEq/L or beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) >/=
      1.2 mmol/L. The peak incidence of SHPC was at 1 DIM for all groups (11%, 42% and 
      60% for parities 1, 2, and >/=3, respectively). All parity groups lost weight
      (21, 33, and 34 kg) during the first 30 DIM. Parity 1 animals with disease
      compared with those without disease lost the most weight (2.6 kg/day BW loss vs. 
      <1.9 kg/day, respectively). Normocalcemic parity 2 animals with either NEB or
      disease lost the most weight (>5 kg/day) compared with those in the SHPC group
      (</=4.5 kg/day). In parity >/= 3 animals, SHPC was an important factor for BW
      loss; SHPC animals lost the most weight (>3.7 kg/day) vs. normocalcemic cows
      (</=3.3 kg/day) regardless of NEB or disease status. Even though all animals lost
      weight during early lactation the effect of disease, NEB, and SHPC on BW loss was
      different in each parity group.

TI  - microRNA-7 regulates cell growth, migration and invasion via direct targeting of 
      PAK1 in thyroid cancer.
PG  - 2127-34
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2016.5477 [doi]
AB  - The expression and function of microRNA-7 (miR-7) has been studied in a variety
      of different cancer types. However, to date, no studies have investigated the
      expression of miR7 in human thyroid cancer. In the present study, the expression 
      levels and biological function of miR7 were investigated in human thyroid cancer,
      with the aim of evaluating whether it may serve as a therapeutic biomarker. The
      expression levels of miR7 in human thyroid cancer tissues, matched, adjacent
      normal tissues, normal thyroid tissues and human thyroid cancer cell lines were
      determined using RTqPCR and western blot analysis. To explore the functional role
      of miR7 in human thyroid cancer cell lines, MTT assays, cell migration and
      invasion assays were employed. TargetScan software identified p21 activated
      kinase1 (PAK1) as a putative interacting partner of miR7. Therefore, functional
      assays were performed to explore the effects of endogenous PAK1 in thyroid
      cancer. In the present study, miR7 was significantly downregulated in thyroid
      cancer tissues and cells compared with normal thyroid tissue samples. A
      correlation between miR7 expression and thyroid tumor stage was also observed.
      Ectopic expression of miR7 was found to suppress the proliferation, migra-tion
      and invasion of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. Dual-luciferase reporter assays
      demonstrated that PAK1 was a direct target of miR-7 in vitro. RT-qPCR and western
      blot analysis demonstrated that miR7 negatively regulates PAK1 protein expression
      but has no effect on PAK1 mRNA expression. Knockdown of PAK1 expression markedly 
      suppressed thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. These
      results suggest that miR7 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting PAK1
      directly and may therefore present a novel therapeutic target for the treatment
      of thyroid cancer.

      chemotherapy.
PG  - 847-53
LID - 10.1007/s00280-010-1360-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Prognostic factors for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer
      receiving chemotherapy are presently not well established. Gallbladder cancer and
      intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma are previously reported prognostic factors of
      poor prognosis; however, tumor volume has not been analyzed in these previous
      reports. METHODS: We analyzed 56 consecutive patients with advanced biliary tract
      cancer who had received gemcitabine and S-1 combination chemotherapy as
      first-line palliative chemotherapy. Prognostic factors, including the baseline
      sum longest diameter (BSLD) representing tumor volume in Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumor, were evaluated. RESULTS: By multivariate analysis, age
      >/=70 (HR 3.01, 95% CI 1.25-7.31, P = 0.014) and larger BSLD (HR 1.09, 95% CI
      1.01-1.18, P = 0.021) were statistically significant independent predictors of
      poor prognosis. Primary biliary site was not identified as a prognostic factor (P
      = 0.728). Median survival times of patients with BSLDs </= 9.0 cm and BSLDs > 9.0
      cm were 18.7 and 8.8 months, respectively (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Age and BSLD 
      were identified as strong prognostic factors for patients with advanced biliary
      tract cancer receiving chemotherapy. Tumor volume might be more important than
      primary biliary site for the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer.

TI  - Medical education in Ecuador.
PG  - 979-84
LID - 10.3109/0142159X.2013.826789 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ecuador, the smallest of the Andean countries, is located in the
      northwest portion of South America. The nation's 14.5 million people have a
      tremendous need for high quality primary care. AIMS: To describe the profound
      advances as well as the persistent needs in medical education in Ecuador that
      have occurred with globalization and with the modernization of the country.
      METHODS: Through an extensive search of the literature; medical school data;
      reports from the Ecuador Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Education; and
      information from the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, and
      Innovation (SENESCYT), the medical education system in Ecuador has been
      thoroughly examined. RESULTS: The National System of Higher Education in Ecuador 
      has experienced significant growth over the last 20 years. As of 2009 the system 
      boasts 19 medical schools, all of which offer the required education needed to
      obtain the title of Physician, but only 12 of which offer postgraduate clinical
      training. Of these 19 universities, nine are public, five are private and
      self-financed, and five are private and co-financed. Post-graduate options for
      medical students include: (1) Clinical specialization, (2) Higher diploma, (3)
      Course specialization, (4) Master's degree, and (5) PhD degree. CONCLUSION: The
      rapid growth of Ecuador's system of medical education has led to inevitable gaps 
      that threaten its ability to sustain itself. Chief among these is the lack of
      well-trained faculty to supply its medical schools. To ensure an adequate supply 
      of faculty exists, the creation of sufficient postgraduate, sub-specialization,
      and PhD training positions must be created and maintained.

TI  - Survey on the Status of Smoking Inside Eating Establishments in the Cities of
      Kobe and Amagasaki.
PG  - 1852-1857
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-17-0861 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hyogo Prefectural Government has been enforcing a smoking ban
      ordinance since April 2013. The present survey was conducted to determine the
      extent to which the smoking ban has been successfully implemented in eating
      establishments in Kobe City and Amagasaki City.Methods and Results:The Health and
      Welfare Department of the Hyogo Prefectural Government provided a list of eating 
      establishments in Kobe and Amagasaki City. From these, we chose 1,300 from each
      city using random number generation. Responses were obtained from 310
      establishments in Kobe City (response rate: 23.8%) and 297 in Amagasaki City
      (22.8%). Overall, 58.1% of the establishments surveyed in Kobe City were aware of
      the ordinance, a recognition rate significantly higher than that of Amagasaki
      City, where only 45.5% of eateries were aware of the ordinance (P=0.003). Of the 
      Kobe City eateries, 31.7% had succeeded in implementing a complete ban on
      smoking. In Amagasaki City, the rate was significantly lower, at just 13.4%
      (P<0.001). A logistic regression analysis showed that coffee shops,
      Japanese-style taverns, bars, and eating establishments that served alcohol were 
      the independent significant predictors of low compliance. Kobe City restaurants, 
      women, and families were the independent significant predictors of high
      compliance with the complete smoking ban. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of recognition
      and implementation of the complete smoking ban were significantly lower in
      Amagasaki City than in Kobe City. There needs to be a strong and continuous
      socialization campaign to promote the ordinance.

TI  - Blood microRNAs as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in cerebral
      ischemic injury.
PG  - 1375-1378
AB  - MicroRNAs are a family of small, genome-encoded endogenous RNAs that are
      transcribed but are not translated into proteins. They serve essential roles in
      virtually every aspect of brain function, including neurogenesis, neural
      development, and cellular responses leading to changes in synaptic plasticity.
      They are also implicated in neurodegeneration and neurological disorders, in
      responses to hypoxia and ischemia, and in ischemic tolerance induced by ischemic 
      preconditioning. In recent developments, miRNA expression profiling has been
      examined in stroke, and these studies indicate that miRNAs have emerged as key
      mediators in ischemic stroke biology. Both increased and decreased miRNA levels
      may be needed either as prevention or treatment of stroke. Novel approaches are
      being developed to get miRNA related therapeutics into the brain across an intact
      blood-brain barrier, including chemical modification, use of targeting molecules 
      and methods to disrupt the blood-brain barrier.

TI  - Constitutive phosphorylation of cardiac myosin regulatory light chain prevents
      development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in mice.
PG  - E4138-46
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1505819112 [doi]
AB  - Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)-dependent phosphorylation of the regulatory
      light chain (RLC) of cardiac myosin is known to play a beneficial role in heart
      disease, but the idea of a phosphorylation-mediated reversal of a hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM) phenotype is novel. Our previous studies on transgenic (Tg) 
      HCM-RLC mice revealed that the D166V (Aspartate166 --> Valine) mutation-induced
      changes in heart morphology and function coincided with largely reduced RLC
      phosphorylation in situ. We hypothesized that the introduction of a
      constitutively phosphorylated Serine15 (S15D) into the hearts of D166V mice would
      prevent the development of a deleterious HCM phenotype. In support of this
      notion, MLCK-induced phosphorylation of D166V-mutated hearts was found to rescue 
      some of their abnormal contractile properties. Tg-S15D-D166V mice were generated 
      with the human cardiac RLC-S15D-D166V construct substituted for mouse cardiac RLC
      and were subjected to functional, structural, and morphological assessments. The 
      results were compared with Tg-WT and Tg-D166V mice expressing the human
      ventricular RLC-WT or its D166V mutant, respectively. Echocardiography and
      invasive hemodynamic studies demonstrated significant improvements of intact
      heart function in S15D-D166V mice compared with D166V, with the systolic and
      diastolic indices reaching those monitored in WT mice. A largely reduced maximal 
      tension and abnormally high myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity observed in
      D166V-mutated hearts were reversed in S15D-D166V mice. Low-angle X-ray
      diffraction study revealed that altered myofilament structures present in
      HCM-D166V mice were mitigated in S15D-D166V rescue mice. Our collective results
      suggest that expression of pseudophosphorylated RLC in the hearts of HCM mice is 
      sufficient to prevent the development of the pathological HCM phenotype.

TI  - A systematic video analysis of National Hockey League (NHL) concussions, part I: 
      who, when, where and what?
PG  - 547-51
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is a growing understanding of the consequences of
      concussions in hockey, very little is known about the precipitating factors
      associated with this type of injury. AIM: To describe player characteristics and 
      situational factors associated with concussions in the National Hockey League
      (NHL). METHODS: Case series of medically diagnosed concussions for regular season
      games over a 3.5-year period during the 2006-2010 seasons using an inclusive
      cohort of professional hockey players. Digital video records were coded and
      analysed using the Heads Up Checklist. RESULTS: Of 197 medically diagnosed
      concussions, 88% involved contact with an opponent. Forwards accounted for more
      concussions than expected compared with on-ice proportional representation (95%
      CI 60 to 73; p=0.04). Significantly more concussions occurred in the first period
      (47%) compared with the second and third periods (p=0.047), with the majority of 
      concussions occurring in the defensive zone (45%). Approximately 47% of the
      concussions occurred in open ice, 53% occurred in the perimeter. Finally, 37% of 
      the concussions involved injured players' heads contacting the boards or glass.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study describes several specific factors associated with
      concussions in the NHL, including period of the game, player position, body size,
      and specific locations on the ice and particular situations based on a player's
      position.

TI  - Traumatic graft rupture after primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction: retrospective analysis of incidence and risk factors in 2915
      cases.
PG  - 1535-1541
LID - 10.1007/s00167-015-3699-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine incidence and risk factors for traumatic graft rupture
      following primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
      METHODS: All cases of isolated ACL reconstructions (primary or revision)
      performed at our institution between January 2007 and December 2010 were
      included. From this group of 2467 primary reconstructions (32.4 +/- 12.2 years)
      and 448 revision reconstructions (33.0 +/- 10.4 years), we identified all
      patients who underwent revision ACL reconstruction following traumatic graft
      rupture in further course and all patients who underwent contralateral primary
      ACL reconstruction until January 2014. Age, gender, time from index procedure and
      graft diameter (for hamstring autografts) were analysed in terms of being a
      potential risk factor for graft rupture. RESULTS: Within a follow-up period of
      5.0 +/- 1.1 years (3.0-7.0), a total of 82 traumatic graft ruptures were
      identified, resulting in an incidence of 2.8 %. Seventy-three cases were seen
      following primary reconstructions (3.0 %), and nine cases following revision
      reconstructions (2.0 %), respectively (n.s.). Age younger than 25 years was
      identified as a risk factor for both groups (p = 0.001 and p = 0.008; odds ratio 
      6.0 and 6.4, respectively). In primary reconstruction, male patients had a higher
      risk of graft rupture compared with females (3.7 vs. 1.6 %; p = 0.005), and the
      first year after index procedure was associated with a higher risk of graft
      rupture compared with the following (p < 0.001). Graft diameter did not influence
      the risk of graft rupture. Incidence of contralateral ACL rupture was 3.1 %,
      which was not different to the incidence of graft rupture ipsilaterally (n.s.).
      CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were seen between graft
      rupture incidence of primary and revision ACL reconstructions. Young age (<25
      years) and short time to the index procedure (especially within the first year)
      were confirmed as risk factors for graft rupture in both groups. Male gender was 
      a risk factor for primary reconstructions. Graft diameter had no influence on
      graft rupture rates. No difference in incidence of graft rupture compared to ACL 
      rupture on the contralateral side was apparent. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective 
      case series, Level IV.

TI  - Transcatheter Sapien valve implantation in a native tricuspid valve after failed 
      surgical repair.
PG  - 841-5
LID - 10.1002/ccd.25330 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We describe the first report of a transcatheter Sapien implantation
      in a native tricuspid valve after multiple failed surgical repairs with a lack of
      prosthetic material and radiographic landmarks. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 47-year
      old female underwent multiple valve repairs and replacements including three
      tricuspid valve repairs without surgical ring or bioprosthesis implantation. She 
      developed signs of right heart failure associated with a mixed tricuspid disease 
      combining a severe stenosis and regurgitation. After surgical turn down, a
      revalvulation using a transcatheter approach was attempted. The challenges in
      this case were the absence of a stiff region to anchor the percutaneous valve,
      the lack of radiographic landmarks and the difficulties of precise annulus
      measurements. The applied strategy was -under general anesthesia and
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-: balloon sizing, prestenting of the
      tricuspid annulus using covered stents followed by Sapien valve implantation
      through the femoral vein under fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography 
      (TEE). The procedure was successfull, solving the tricuspid leak and stenosis
      (peak gradient from 22 to 3 mm Hg) using two Sapien for a perfect positioning. It
      was complicated by pulmonary bleeding due to a distal wire exit, treated
      successfully by coil embolization. The clinical and echocardiographic outcome was
      good up to 5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter Sapien valve implantation in a
      native tricuspid valve after failed multiple surgical repairs is feasible by the 
      femoral vein. Technical challenges due to the lack of rigid landing zone and
      fluoroscopic markers were solved by prestenting and valve implantation under
      bi-plane fluoroscopic and TEE guidance.

TI  - An unusual case of left venous renal entrapment syndrome: a new type of
      nutcracker phenomenon?
PG  - 263-7
LID - 10.1007/s00276-012-1027-7 [doi]
AB  - Left venous renal entrapment syndrome was observed during multidetector 64-row
      computer tomography and color Doppler ultrasonography in a 58-year-old Caucasian 
      female hospitalized due to choledocholithiasis. The patient demonstrated no
      typical symptoms of nutcracker syndrome. The left renal vein (LRV) was compressed
      as it passed between the superior mesenteric artery and the right renal artery.
      The LRV lumen measured 1.7 x 7.8 mm (width x height) at the point of narrowing
      and 7.5 x 17 mm before this. Secondary to the nutcracker phenomenon, the course
      of left ovarian vein was winding and was significantly wider than the
      contralateral vessel.

PG  - 193-9

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of competitive exclusion 
      (CE) Escherichia coli cultures (ATCC 202018 and 202019) for reducing E. coli O157
      in batch culture fermentations with ruminal or fecal microbial inoculum derived
      from a cannulated feedlot steer fed a corn-grain-based, high-grain diet. A non-CE
      (NCE) E. coli strain (ATCC 25922) was included as a control. Anaerobic
      fermentations (50 mL) were set up in serum bottles with a 2:1 mineral buffer to
      microbial inoculum ratio and with or without gluconic acid, a component of
      intestinal mucus, which has been shown to be stimulatory to the growth of E. coli
      O157 in vitro. A five-strain mixture of E. coli O157 made resistant to nalidixic 
      acid (50 microg/mL; Nal(R)) was added to each fermentation, and concentrations of
      Nal(R) E. coli O157 were determined after 0, 6, 12, and 24 h of fermentation. In 
      ruminal microbial fermentation, the CE treatment had a lower (0.6 log; p < 0.01) 
      concentration of Nal(R) E. coli O157 than the NCE control at 24 h, regardless of 
      gluconic acid inclusion. In fecal microbial fermentation, the CE treatment did
      not affect Nal(R) E. coli O157 concentrations in fermentations without gluconic
      acid; but with gluconic acid inclusion, Nal(R) E. coli O157 concentrations were
      lower in the CE treatment than in NCE controls at 12 h (1.7 log CFU/mL lower) and
      24 h (1.9 log CFU/mL lower). In vitro fermentation with ruminal or fecal
      microbial inoculum could be a simple and inexpensive initial approach to assess
      efficacy of CE cultures for reducing E. coli O157.

TI  - Dependability: a challenge for electrical medical implants.
PG  - 5923-6
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627546 [doi]
AB  - Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is an attractive solution to restore some
      lost or failing physiological functions. Obviously, the FES system may be
      hazardous for patient and the reliability and dependability of the system must be
      maximal. Unfortunately, the present context, where the associated systems are
      more and more complex and their development needs very cross-disciplinary
      experts, is not favorable to safety. Moreover, the direct adaptation of the
      existing dependability techniques from domains such as space or automotive is not
      suitable. Firstly, this paper proposes a strategy for risk management at system
      level for FES medical implant. The idea is to give a uniform framework where all 
      possible hazards are highlighted and associated consequences are minimized. Then,
      the paper focuses on critical parts of the FES system: analog micro-circuit which
      generates the electrical signal to electrode. As this micro-circuit is the
      closest to the human tissue, any failure might involve very critical consequences
      for the patient. We propose a concurrent top-down and bottom-up approach where
      the critical elements are highlighted and an extended risk analysis is performed.

PG  - 2312-6
AB  - Today, a growing number of people, some of them suffering from lung diseases,
      travel to high altitude resorts. It is sometimes not easy for the general
      practitioner to adequately counsel these patients. Based on our knowledge of
      physiopathology and clinical studies, the present paper addresses the effects of 
      high altitude in patients with preexisting lung diseases and provides
      recommendations in order to optimize the sojourn at high altitude.

TI  - Frequent daytime naps predict vocabulary growth in early childhood.
PG  - 1008-17
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The facilitating role of sleep for language learning is well-attested
      in adults and to a lesser extent in infants and toddlers. However, the
      longitudinal relationship between sleep patterns and early vocabulary development
      is not well understood. METHODS: This study investigates how measures of sleep
      are related to the development of vocabulary size in infants and toddlers. Day
      and night-time sleeping patterns of infants and toddlers were compared with their
      concurrent and subsequent vocabulary development. Sleep assessments were
      conducted using a sleep diary specifically designed to facilitate accurate
      parental report. Sleep measures were used as predictors in a multilevel growth
      curve analysis of vocabulary development. RESULTS: The number of daytime naps was
      positively associated with both predicted expressive (p = .062) and receptive
      vocabulary growth (p = .006), whereas the length of night-time sleep was
      negatively associated with rate of predicted expressive vocabulary growth (p =
      .045). Sleep efficiency was also positively associated with both predicted
      receptive (p = .001) and expressive vocabulary growth (p = .068). CONCLUSIONS:
      These results point to a longitudinal relationship between sleep and language
      development, with a particular emphasis on the importance of napping at this age.

TI  - The airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine may be predicted by impulse
      oscillometry and plethysmography in children with well-controlled asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a hallmark of asthma. Methacholine
      challenge test which is mostly used to confirm AHR is not routinely available.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive values of fractional
      exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), impulse oscillometry (IOS), and plethysmography for 
      the assessment of AHR in children with well-controlled asthma. METHODS: 60
      children with controlled allergic asthma aged 6-18 years participated in the
      study. FeNO measurement, spirometry, IOS, and plethysmography were performed.
      Methacholine challenge test was done to assess AHR. PC20 and dose response slope 
      (DRS) of methacholine was calculated. RESULTS: Mild to severe AHR with PC20 < 4
      mg/ml was confirmed in 31 (51.7%) patients. Baseline FeNO and total specific
      airway resistance (SRtot)%pred and residual volume (RV)%pred levels in
      plethysmography were significantly higher and FEV1%pred, FEV1/FVC%pred, MMEF%pred
      values were lower in the group with PC20 < 4 mg/ml. FeNO, SRtot%pred, and RV%pred
      levels were found to be positively correlated with DRS methacholine. The higher
      baseline FeNO, frequency dependence of resistance (R5-R20) in IOS and SRtot%pred 
      in plethysmography were found to be significantly related to DRS methacholine in 
      linear regression analysis (beta: 1.35, p = 0.046, beta: 4.58, p = 0.002, and
      beta: 0.78, p = 0.035, respectively). The cut-off points for FeNO and SRtot% for 
      differentiating asthmatic children with PC20 < 4 mg/ml from those with PC20 >/= 4
      mg/ml were 28 ppb (sensitivity: 67.7%, specificity: 72.4%, p < 0.001) and 294.9% 
      (sensitivity: 35.5%, specificity: 96.6%, p = 0.013), respectively. CONCLUSION:
      IOS and plethysmography may serve as reliable and practical tools for prediction 
      of mild to severe methacholine induced AHR in otherwise "seemingly
      well-controlled'' asthma.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease in which genetic determinants are
      modulated by hormonal, environmental and nutritional factors. The balance between
      bone resorption and bone formation seems to be regulated by a variety of growth
      factors and cytokines. An important clinical risk factor in the pathogenesis of
      osteoporosis is the presence of genetic polymorphisms in susceptibility genes. In
      this study, we investigated the association between osteoporosis and interleukin 
      10 (IL-10) -597 C > A and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) T869C
      (also named Leu10 > Pro) polymorphisms in Turkish postmenopausal women. Genomic
      DNA obtained from 255 individuals (152 osteoporotic and 103 healthy controls).
      The DNA sample was isolated from peripheral bloods by salting-out method and
      analyzed by the techniques of PCR-RFLP. Genotype and allele frequencies were
      calculated and data were analyzed using the chi(2) test. We found a statistically
      significant difference between the groups with respect to IL-10 genotype
      distribution (p = 0.001) and allele frequencies (p < 0.0002). However, we did not
      found any difference between the groups with regarding TGF-beta1 genotype
      distribution and allele frequencies (p > 0.05). In the combined genotype
      analysis, IL-10/TGF-beta1 CCCC combine genotype was also estimated risk factor
      for osteoporosis in Turkish postmenopausal women (p = 0.026). To our knowledge,
      this is the first report to examine IL-10 gene -597 C > A polymorphism and
      osteoporosis in Turkish population.

AB  - The evolutional and biological roles of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are
      less recognized compared to those of L1. In the present study, we focused on the 
      transcriptional activity of HERVs in normal human tissues and found five HERV
      loci that are actively expressed in normal tissues. All but one showed tissue
      specificity of expression: one was expressed in stomach and small intestine and
      three were in placenta. We subsequently examined by TaqMan-based RT-PCR assays
      the temporal expression profiles of the three placenta-specific HERVs along with 
      syncytin and syncytin 2 and observed three patterns. Syncytin and HERV-Fb showed 
      almost constant expression through gestations. Syncytin 2 gradually decreased as 
      pregnancy proceeded. In contrast, expression from the HERV-H/F and HERV-K(HML-6) 
      loci increased remarkably in term placentas. Term placentas in general showed
      larger interindividual differences in HERV expression levels. Our results suggest
      that HERVs might have more diverse effects than currently thought.

TI  - Mechanism of Off-Target Interactions and Toxicity of Tamoxifen and Its
      Metabolites.
PG  - 1492-1507
LID - 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00112 [doi]
AB  - Tamoxifen is an estrogen modulator that acts to competitively inhibit the binding
      of endogenous estrogens. It is widely used for treatment of breast cancer;
      however, analogous with many antineoplastic agents, tamoxifen is associated with 
      numerous adverse effects, most prominently nausea. We have identified several
      off-target receptors of tamoxifen and 22 of its metabolites that include
      histamine H1 and H3, and muscarinic M1, M4, and M5 subtypes, and dopamine D2
      receptor. We have shown how they are associated with tamoxifen and its
      metabolites' toxicity through a comprehensive computational analysis of their
      interaction modes, which were also compared to that of the related endogenous
      substrates of each receptor. The results were further evaluated using available
      in vivo and in vitro data. The presented work provides foundational knowledge
      toward the determination of the precise mechanism of nausea induction, and in
      particular, interactions of tamoxifen and its metabolites with the receptors
      involved in that biomolecular pathway. This study can assist in predicting the
      potential undesired effects of the chemicals with common pharmacophores or
      similar fragments to that of tamoxifen and its metabolites and serve drug
      discovery research in developing more effective and tolerable tamoxifen analogues
      or chemotherapeutic agents.

TI  - Bed Bugs: Prevalence in Low-Income Communities, Resident's Reactions, and
      Implementation of a Low-Cost Inspection Protocol.
PG  - 639-646
AB  - We examined bed bug prevalence in 2,372 low-income apartments within 43 buildings
      in four New Jersey cities using a combination of resident interviews, brief
      visual inspections, and monitoring with Climbup Insect Interceptors. Infestation 
      rates ranged from 3.8 to 29.5% among the buildings, with an overall infestation
      rate of 12.3%. Within each apartment, the bed area trapped significantly more bed
      bugs per trap than the sofa (or upholstered chair) area. African American
      residents had a proportionally higher number of bed bug infestations than white
      residents. Women were more likely to report bed bug bite symptoms than men. Only 
      68% of the residents who experienced bed bug infestations reported symptoms after
      being bitten (n = 475). Among those with self-reported symptoms (n = 319), the
      frequency of the reported symptoms was: pain 90%, itchiness 20%, welts 13%, and
      insomnia 8%. Fifty-nine percent of the residents (n = 539) who experienced bed
      bug infestations applied insecticides to control bed bugs. Climbup interceptors
      detected 89 +/- 1% and brief visual inspections detected 72 +/- 3% of the
      infestations. Only two out of 291 infestations were not detected by brief visual 
      inspection or interceptors. Assuming US$50 per hour labor rate, the average per
      apartment cost for the building-wide bed bug monitoring protocol was US$12 per
      apartment. Forty-nine percent of the infestations detected by the protocol were
      in apartments whose residents were unaware of the bed bug activity.

LID - 10.1364/AO.51.000776 [doi]
AB  - We have fabricated a very narrow bandpass tunable terahertz (THz) filter based on
      a one-dimensional photonic crystal cavity. Since the filter consists of silicon
      wafers and air spacers, it has a very high quality factor of about 1500. The full
      width at half maximum (FWHM) of the passband is only about 200 MHz, and the peak 
      transmission is higher than -4 dB. Besides, the central frequency can be tuned
      rapidly over the entire bandgap with the length of cavity adjusted by a motorized
      linear stage. Further analytical calculations indicate that a high-Q tunable
      filter with both high peak transmission and wide tunable range is possible if
      thinner silicon layers are used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resection of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and portal vein (PV) 
      involved in pancreatic neoplasms improves the chances of complete tumor removal. 
      No consensus exists, however, on the optimal reconstructive approach, and
      postoperative venous stenosis in the first 6 months to 1 year can cause patient
      morbidity. We investigated medium-term patency after direct, end-to-end venous
      anastomosis and evaluate predictive factors for stenosis or occlusion. METHODS:
      We analyzed retrospectively the records of 810 patients who underwent
      pancreatectomy at our institution from January 2000 through April 2014, and 197
      patients who underwent concurrent SMV/PV resection were selected. The venous
      anastomosis was assessed every 4 or 6 months postoperatively by the use of
      portography with computed tomography. Preoperative and intraoperative variables
      were evaluated for their possible association with the development of severe
      anastomotic stenosis (>/=70% occlusion). RESULTS: Among patients whose cancer did
      not recur during the 1-year follow-up period, 18 developed severe stenosis.
      Univariate analyses showed that operation time >/=520 minutes and length of
      SMV/PV resection >/=31 mm were associated with the development of severe
      anastomotic stenosis. Multivariate analysis showed that length of SMV/PV
      resection >/=31 mm was among independent predictors of medium-term, severe
      anastomotic stenosis (hazard ratio, 5.96; 95% confidence interval 1.79-22.69; P =
      .003). CONCLUSION: Direct end-to-end anastomosis of the PV system is safe and
      offers patients with periampullary neoplasia improved chances of complete tumor
      excision. When tension-free anastomosis cannot be guaranteed, generally in cases 
      requiring >/=31 mm of SMV/PV resection, venous autografting may decrease the
      likelihood of anastomotic stenosis.

TI  - Thyroid carcinoma in children and adolescents resulting from the Chernobyl
      accident: possible causes of the incidence increase overestimation.
PG  - 50-2
AB  - The Chernobyl accident in the nuclear power plant on 26th April 1986 was followed
      by numerous publications overestimating the medical consequences of the disaster.
      In the publications, interpretations of spontaneous diseases as
      radiation-induced, indication of radioactivity or dose levels without
      confrontation with the natural radiation background, or conclusions about
      incidence increase without comparison with the increase tendencies in larger
      regions or the whole country, can be found. Improved diagnostics after the
      Chernobyl accident is not always taken into account. The high figures could have 
      been caused in some cases by non-random material selection or inadequate
      morphological assessment of biopsy specimens. The application of the
      linear-no-threshold theory to the inhabitants of contaminated areas contributed
      to an overestimation of medical consequences of the Chernobyl accident as well.
      The incidence increase of thyroid carcinoma in children and adolescents started
      in 1990, four years after the accident. High tumor expectancy after the accident,
      in the circumstances of limited technical possibilities and outdated equipment of
      histological laboratories, contributed to a higher number of registered cases.
      The quality of specimens necessary for the assessment of nuclear criteria of
      papillary carcinoma was not always achieved at that time. The incidence increase 
      of thyroid carcinoma can, at least in part, be explained by improved detection of
      thyroid nodules with occasional false-positive conclusions about malignancy.
      Besides, latent carcinomas and well-differentiated thyroid tumors of uncertain
      malignant potential, diagnosed as malignancies, could have additionally
      contributed to the high figures.

PG  - e1002234
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002234 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to influenza viruses is necessary, but not sufficient, for healthy human
      hosts to develop symptomatic illness. The host response is an important
      determinant of disease progression. In order to delineate host molecular
      responses that differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic Influenza A infection, 
      we inoculated 17 healthy adults with live influenza (H3N2/Wisconsin) and examined
      changes in host peripheral blood gene expression at 16 timepoints over 132 hours.
      Here we present distinct transcriptional dynamics of host responses unique to
      asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. We show that symptomatic hosts invoke,
      simultaneously, multiple pattern recognition receptors-mediated antiviral and
      inflammatory responses that may relate to virus-induced oxidative stress. In
      contrast, asymptomatic subjects tightly regulate these responses and exhibit
      elevated expression of genes that function in antioxidant responses and
      cell-mediated responses. We reveal an ab initio molecular signature that strongly
      correlates to symptomatic clinical disease and biomarkers whose expression
      patterns best discriminate early from late phases of infection. Our results
      establish a temporal pattern of host molecular responses that differentiates
      symptomatic from asymptomatic infections and reveals an asymptomatic host-unique 
      non-passive response signature, suggesting novel putative molecular targets for
      both prognostic assessment and ameliorative therapeutic intervention in seasonal 
      and pandemic influenza.

TI  - Apoptosis induced by aspirin and 5-fluorouracil in human colonic adenocarcinoma
      cells.
PG  - 1025-32
AB  - Various biochemical, clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that aspirin
      (ASA) and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) demonstrate
      antineoplastic properties, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibiting
      the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. The mechanism of action may be
      prostaglandin mediated through inhibition of the COX enzymatic system. This
      includes two iso-enzymes, COX-I and COX-II, working in concert with the
      activation of apoptosis, activation of immune surveillance, inhibition of
      proliferation, and inhibition of carcinogen activation. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has
      demonstrated activity against colorectal cancer, leading to apoptosis of
      neoplastic cells. We evaluated the effects of varying doses of ASA (0.5, 1, 1.5
      mM), both as a single agent and in combination with 5-FU (50 microg) in HT-29, a 
      colon adenocarcinoma cell line. Proliferation assays showed that aspirin at a
      concentration of 1 mM inhibits cell growth. Cells treated with ASA, both alone
      and in combination with 5-FU, demonstrated apoptotic activity with the
      up-regulation of Bax protein, which is consistent with 5-FU anticancer treatment.
      Furthermore, there was synergistic cell death with ASA and 5-FU. DNA
      fragmentation, TUNEL, and trypan blue exclusion methods indicated that a
      combination of ASA and 5-FU induces apoptosis in cells in a time- and
      concentration-dependent manner. This study serves to further elucidate the
      mechanism of action of ASA, and ASA in combination with 5-FU, in colorectal
      cancer as evidenced by its effect on the HT-29 cell line.

TI  - The prevalence of pediculus capitis among the middle schoolchildren in Fars
      Province, southern Iran.
PG  - 607-10
AB  - UNLABELLED: Background : Pediculosis capitis is a common parasitic infection of
      children. In this study we assessed the prevalence of head pediculosis among the 
      middle schoolchildren in the urban and rural areas of Fars province, southern
      Iran. METHODS: All middle schoolchildren ages 11-14, in all the urban and rural
      areas of the province were screened for head lice infestation by examining their 
      hair and scalp. The parents of the infested children were also examined. The
      study was repeated in the different seasons in the same areas. Moreover, the
      infested children were treated with permethrin shampoo and re-examined one week
      later for any relapse. RESULTS: The general prevalence of head lice infestation
      in middle school students was 0.23% in autumn, 0.27% in winter and 0.11% in
      spring. In all three seasons, pediculosis capitis prevalence was higher among
      females and in the rural areas. Treatment with permethrin shampoo was markedly
      more successful in males from both regions in all months except the urban areas
      in spring. CONCLUSION: The results show that pediculus capitis is generally
      uncommon among Fars Province middle schoolchildren. It is needed that health
      providers promote heath education programs especially in the rural areas.

TI  - Debating deposits: an interobserver variability study of lymph nodes and
      pericolonic tumor deposits in colonic adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 636-42
LID - 10.5858/arpa.2013-0166-OA [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The American Joint Committee on Cancer's Cancer Staging Manual 7th
      edition defines pericolonic tumor deposits (TDs) as discrete tumor foci in
      pericolic fat showing no evidence of residual lymph node (LN). This definition
      relies on subjective features rather than size (5th edition) or shape (6th
      edition) and introduced the category N1c. Although typically straightforward,
      metastases are encountered for which the distinction between LNs and TDs is
      unclear. For data to be meaningful, agreement on distinguishing features between 
      positive LNs and TDs is needed. OBJECTIVES: To assess agreement among
      gastrointestinal pathologists evaluating difficult metastases and to report the
      distinguishing features they found helpful. DESIGN: Twenty-five tumor metastases 
      from right-sided colonic adenocarcinomas were selected in which the distinction
      between positive LNs and TDs was challenging. Virtual slides were reviewed by 7
      gastrointestinal pathologists. A list of features potentially helpful in
      differentiating positive LNs and TDs was ranked for usefulness by each
      pathologist. Every metastasis was diagnosed as positive LN or TD. For each case
      diagnosed as positive LN, reviewers were asked to list every feature used in
      diagnosis. RESULTS: Complete agreement was found for 11 of 25 metastases, 5
      positive LNs and 6 TDs (kappa statistic, 0.48; 95% confidence interval,
      0.28-0.67). Top-ranked features included round shape, peripheral lymphocyte rim, 
      peripheral lymphoid follicles, possible subcapsular sinus, residual LN in
      surrounding fibroadipose tissue, and thick capsule. The top used features were
      similar among reviewers. CONCLUSIONS: Significant agreement on positive LNs and
      TDs in difficult colonic adenocarcinoma metastases was found among evaluators,
      but inconsistency remains. Round shape, peripheral lymphocyte rim, peripheral
      lymphoid follicles, possible subcapsular sinus, residual LN in surrounding
      fibroadipose tissue, and thick capsule were most often used to aid in diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Teenagers in Sweden were given greater access as consumers of OTC
      drugs in 2009 after the reregulation of the pharmacy market, which allowed for
      the establishment of private pharmacies and sale of specific over-the-counter
      (OTC) drugs in retail stores and gas stations. Increased access to OTC drugs
      could provide new opportunities for self-care but attenuates the opportunity for 
      the traditional expert surveillance of pharmacists, thus increasing the
      possibility of inappropriate OTC drug use. OBJECTIVES: Views of 16-19 year old
      Swedish teenagers on OTC drugs, with special regard to analgesic drugs were
      explored and described, based on the following questions: How and where did they 
      acquire their knowledge and attitudes regarding OTC drugs? What perceptions did
      they have about the use of OTC drugs? METHODS: A qualitative approach with a
      descriptive design was chosen. Data were collected in 2011 with 10 focus group
      discussions with high school students aged 16-19 years from different parts of
      Sweden. A total of 77 teenagers participated, 33 males and 44 females. A manifest
      qualitative content analysis was performed. RESULTS: While most teenagers
      appeared to have responsible attitudes toward OTC drugs and their use, some
      teenagers had attitudes that ranged from casual to careless. The focus group
      discussions also revealed knowledge gaps among teenagers regarding OTC drugs, and
      the significant influence of parents and peers on their OTC drug use.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into how vulnerable some teenagers could
      be as new consumers of OTC drugs and suggested that educational efforts could be 
      geared toward parents as well as teenagers.

      outcome.
PG  - 1415-25
LID - 10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02831.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-eAg in patients 
      with hepatitis B is associated with higher HBV replication and with an increased 
      risk to develop liver-related clinical endpoints defined as liver related death, 
      liver transplantation, development of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic
      decompensation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HBeAg in
      patients co-infected with the hepatitis D virus (HDV). METHODS: We studied
      virological markers of HBV and HDV infection and as well as biochemical and
      clinical features of liver disease in a cohort of 534 anti-HDV-positive patients.
      In addition, we compared the clinical long-term outcome of HBeAg-positive
      HDV-infected patients with HBeAg-negative control patients matched for age,
      gender and baseline-MELD score. RESULTS: HBeAg-positive hepatitis delta was
      detected in 71 of 534 patients (13.3%). HBeAg positivity was associated with a
      higher biochemical disease activity and higher HBsAg levels in HDV co-infected
      patients. Sixty one per cent of the HBeAg-positive HDV-infected patients
      presented with HBV DNA levels below 2000 IU/ml, at least once during follow-up.
      Both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients showed a similar severe clinical
      long-term course with about half of the patients developing a liver-related
      clinical complication after a median follow-up period of 51 months (range: 9-193 
      months). CONCLUSIONS: HBV DNA levels are low in both HBeAg-negative and
      HBeAg-positive patients suggesting suppressive effects of HDV on HBV irrespective
      of the phase of HBV infection. The clinical long-term outcome of HBeAg-positive
      patients is not different to HBeAg-negative patients infected with the HDV.

TI  - Immunohistochemical application of an antibody specific for human CD1a to the
      diagnosis of canine mast cell tumour.
PG  - 40-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jcpa.2008.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Canine mast cell tumours (MCTs) may be graded microscopically for prognostic
      purposes. Grade I (well-differentiated) and grade II (intermediate
      differentiation) tumours have an abundance of metachromatic granules within the
      cytoplasm; however, grade III (poorly differentiated) MCTs may be difficult to
      diagnose as they frequently have fewer discernable granules. Herein we report
      that a cross-reactive anti-human CD1a monoclonal antibody (clone O10) may be used
      in immunohistochemistry to identify canine MCTs of all grades. The antibody was
      applied to tissue sections from 48 canine MCTs of different histological grades. 
      Serial sections from each tumour were stained with toluidine blue and safranin O 
      to compare diagnostic sensitivity. All MCTs were labelled positively by the CD1a 
      antibody, but histochemical staining was often equivocal and identification of
      mast cells was extremely difficult in some cases. This antibody did not label
      neoplastic cells in cases of canine histiocytoma, plasmacytoma or amelanotic
      melanoma; therefore, the reagent may be a valuable marker for the diagnosis of
      canine MCTs, especially those tumours of histological grade III.

TI  - Production of cloned NIBS (Nippon Institute for Biological Science) and alpha-1, 
      3-galactosyltransferase knockout MGH miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear
      transfer using the NIBS breed as surrogates.
PG  - 157-64
LID - 10.1111/xen.12031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nuclear transfer (NT) technologies offer a means for producing the
      genetically modified pigs necessary to develop swine models for mechanistic
      studies of disease processes as well as to serve as organ donors for
      xenotransplantation. Most previous studies have used commercial pigs as
      surrogates. METHOD AND RESULTS: In this study, we established a cloning technique
      for miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using Nippon Institute
      for Biological Science (NIBS) miniature pigs as surrogates. Moreover, utilizing
      this technique, we have successfully produced an alpha-1, 3-galactosyltransferase
      knockout (GalT-KO) miniature swine. Fibroblasts procured from a NIBS miniature
      pig fetus were injected into 1312 enucleated oocytes. The cloned embryos were
      transferred to 11 surrogates of which five successfully delivered 13 cloned
      offspring; the production efficiency was 1.0% (13/1312). In a second experiment, 
      lung fibroblasts obtained from neonatal GalT-KO MGH miniature swine were used as 
      donor cells and 1953 cloned embryos were transferred to 12 surrogates. Six cloned
      offspring were born from five surrogates, a production efficiency of 0.3%
      (6/1953). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate successful establishment of a
      miniature pig cloning technique by SCNT using NIBS miniature pigs as surrogates. 
      To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of successful production of
      GalT-KO miniature swine using miniature swine surrogates. This technique could
      help to ensure a stable supply of the cloned pigs through the use of miniature
      pig surrogates and could expand production in countries with limited space or in 
      facilities with special regulations such as specific pathogen-free or good
      laboratory practice.

      malformation of the brain in which the underlying anomaly is polymicrogyria.
      Polymicrogyria is a malformation of cortical development that is characterized by
      abnormal arrangement and excessive folding of cerebral cortical cell layers,
      often with fusion of the gyral surfaces, which can be focal or regional or
      involve the whole cortical mantle. Clinical manifestations depend upon the
      anatomical region of the brain involved. We report a case of 7-year-old male
      child with magnetic resonance imaging findings of CBPS.

AB  - In this study, an alternative purification method for human paraoxonase 1 (hPON1)
      enzyme was developed using two-step procedures, namely, ammonium sulfate
      precipitation and Sepharose-4B-L-tyrosine-3-aminophenantrene hydrophobic
      interaction chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme 
      indicates a single band with an apparent M(W) of 43 kDa. The enzyme was purified 
      219-fold with a final specific activity of 4,408,400 U/mg and a yield of 10%.
      Furthermore, we examined the in vitro effects of some anabolic compounds, such as
      zeranol, 17 beta-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, oxytocin, and trenbolone on the
      enzyme activity to understand the better inhibitory properties of these
      molecules. The five anabolic compounds dose dependently decreased the activity of
      hPON1 with inhibition constants in the millimolar-micromolar range. The results
      show that these compounds exhibit inhibitory effects on hPON1 at low
      concentrations with IC50 values ranging from 0.064 to 16.900 microM.

TI  - Comparison of different cardiovascular magnetic resonance sequences for native
      myocardial T1 mapping at 3T.
PG  - 65
AB  - BACKGROUND: T1 mapping based on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a
      novel approach using the magnetic relaxation T1 time as a quantitative marker for
      myocardial tissue composition. Various T1 mapping sequences are being used, with 
      different strengths and weaknesses. Data comparing different sequences head to
      head however are sparse. METHODS: We compared three T1 mapping sequences,
      ShMOLLI, MOLLI and SASHA in phantoms and in a mid-ventricular slice of 40 healthy
      individuals (mean age 59 +/- 7 years, 45 % male) with low (68 %) or moderate
      cardiovascular risk. We calculated global and segmental T1 in vivo through
      exponential curve fitting and subsequent parametric mapping. We also analyzed
      image quality and inter-observer reproducibility. RESULTS: There was no
      association of T1 with cardiovascular risk groups. T1 however differed
      significantly depending on the sequence, with SASHA providing consistently higher
      mean values than ShMOLLI and MOLLI (1487 +/- 36 ms vs. 1174 +/- 37 ms and 1199
      +/- 28 ms, respectively; p < 0.001). This difference between sequences was much
      smaller in phantom measurements. In patients, segmental values were lower in the 
      anterior wall for all sequences. Image quality, in general good for the
      steady-state-free-precession readouts in all sequences, was lower for SASHA
      parametric maps. On multivariate regression analysis, a longer T1 measured by
      MOLLI was correlated with lower ejection fraction and female gender.
      Inter-observer variability as assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients
      was excellent for all sequences (ShMOLLI: 0.995; MOLLI: 0.991; SASHA: 0.961; all 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In a cross-sectional population with low to moderate
      cardiovascular risk, we observed a variation in T1 mapping results between
      inversion-recovery vs. saturation-recovery sequences in vivo, which were less
      evident in phantom images, despite a small interobserver variability. Thus,
      physiological factors, most likely related to B1 inhomogeneities, and
      tissue-specific properties, like magnetization transfer, that impact T1 values in
      vivo, render phantom validation insufficient, and have to be further investigated
      for a better understanding of the clinical utility of different T1 mapping
      approaches. TRIAL REGISTRATION: "Canadian Alliance For Healthy Hearts and Minds"

TI  - The effect of stress on the defense systems.
PG  - 10-8
AB  - Acute stress increases resistance to infection. The alteration of this mechanism 
      in chronically stressed people impairs the organism's ability to mount a strong
      immune response with a resultant increase in morbidity. Acute stress induces a
      probable sympatho-adrenergically mediated increase in chemotaxis and adhesion
      molecules expression, thus promoting immune cells migration to sites of infection
      and/or inflammation, while chronic stress impairs this mechanism. Protracted
      stressful conditions decrease NK cytotoxic capacity. There is a substance P,
      which under stressful circumstances mediates the increase in macrophage cytokine 
      production. Acute stress increases T cell mobilization through a
      beta2-adrenergically mediated process, which is blunted during chronic stress.
      Psychological stress impairs the immune system's ability to produce antibodies in
      response to a vaccine, thereby making the organism more vulnerable to infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diencephalic Syndrome is a rare clinical condition of failure to
      thrive despite a normal caloric intake, hyperalertness, hyperkinesis, and
      euphoria usually associated with low-grade hypothalamic astrocytomas. CASE
      PRESENTATION: We reported an unusual case of diencephalic cachexia due to
      hypothalamic anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO-grade III). Baseline endocrine function 
      evaluation was performed in this patient before surgery. After histological
      diagnosis, he enrolled to a chemotherapy program with sequential high-dose
      chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell rescue. The last MRI evaluation 
      showed a good response. The patient is still alive with good visual function 21
      months after starting chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Diencephalic cachexia can rarely
      be due to high-grade hypothalamic astrocytoma. We suggest that a nutritional
      support with chemotherapy given to high doses without radiotherapy could be an
      effective strategy for treatment of a poor-prognosis disease.

TI  - Carbon dots with efficient solid-state red-light emission through the
      step-by-step surface modification towards light-emitting diodes.
PG  - 3811-3818
LID - 10.1039/c7dt04579d [doi]
AB  - Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted extensive attention over the past decade due to 
      their excellent advantages. However, few attempts have been reported for
      realizing the long-wavelength emission, especially for obtaining efficient
      solid-state red emission with high photoluminescence quantum yield (QY). Herein, 
      we developed highly red light emitting CDs by the step-by-step surface
      modifications of the nitrogen-doped CDs. By introducing hexadecyltrimethyl
      ammonium bromide to modulate a red CD aqueous solution, the photoluminescence QY 
      increases from 23.2% to 43.6%. Furthermore, we dispersed CDs in a PVP matrix for 
      a solid-state film, where the solid-state quenching was effectively suppressed,
      and high QY (41.3%) of red light emission was achieved. Taking advantage of the
      as-prepared red light emitting CDs combining with the reported high quantum yield
      blue and green light emitting CDs, we realized UV-pumped WLEDs with tunable
      correlated color temperature from 7879 to 2961 K. Moreover, a high color
      rendering index (CRI) of 93 for WLEDs was realized, which is superior than the
      best records for the semiconductor quantum dot based WLEDs. Finally, the red
      light emitting CDs were demonstrated to have promising application as a red color
      converter in traditional YAG-based WLEDs to improve their CCT and CRI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sildenafil and calcitonin gene-related peptide are vasoactive
      substances that induce migraine attacks in patients. The intradural arteries are 
      thought to be involved, but these have never been examined in vivo. Sildenafil is
      the only migraine-inducing compound for which cephalic, extracranial artery
      dilation is not reported. Here, we investigate the effects of sildenafil and
      calcitonin gene-related peptide on the extracranial and intradural parts of the
      middle meningeal artery. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, three-way
      crossover, placebo-controlled head-to-head comparison study, MR-angiography was
      recorded in healthy volunteers at baseline and twice after study drug
      (sildenafil/ calcitonin gene-related peptide/saline) administration.
      Circumferences of extracranial and intradural middle meningeal artery segments
      were measured using semi-automated analysis software. The area under the curve
      for circumference change was compared using paired t-tests between study days.
      RESULTS: Twelve healthy volunteers completed the study. The area under the
      curveBaseline-120min was significantly larger on both the sildenafil and the
      calcitonin gene-related peptide day in the intradural middle meningeal artery
      (calcitonin gene-related peptide, p = 0.013; sildenafil, p = 0.027) and the
      extracranial middle meningeal artery (calcitonin gene-related peptide, p =
      0.0003; sildenafil, p = 0.021), compared to placebo. Peak intradural middle
      meningeal artery dilation was 9.9% (95% CI [2.9-16.9]) after sildenafil (T30min) 
      and 12.5% (95% CI [8.1-16.8]) after calcitonin gene-related peptide (T30min).
      Peak dilation of the extracranial middle meningeal artery after calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (T30min) was 15.7% (95% CI [11.2-20.1]) and 18.9% (95% CI
      [12.8-24.9]) after sildenafil (T120min). CONCLUSION: An important novel finding
      is that both sildenafil and calcitonin gene-related peptide dilate intradural
      arteries, supporting the notion that all known pharmacological migraine triggers 
      dilate cephalic vessels. We suggest that intradural artery dilation is associated
      with headache induced by calcitonin gene-related peptide and sildenafil.

AB  - Activation of transcription requires alteration of chromatin by complexes that
      increase the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Removing nucleosomes from
      regulatory sequences has been proposed to play a significant role in activation. 
      We tested whether changes in nucleosome occupancy occurred on the set of genes
      that is activated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). We observed no decrease
      in occupancy on most promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers. Instead, there was an
      increase in the accessibility of nucleosomes, as measured by micrococcal nuclease
      (MNase) digestion and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin [ATAC]
      using sequencing), that did not result from removal of the nucleosome. Thus,
      changes in nucleosome accessibility predominate over changes in nucleosome
      occupancy during rapid transcriptional induction during the UPR.

LID - 10.1126/science.1182837 [doi]
AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution of fault slip is a critical parameter in
      earthquake source models. Previous geomorphic and geologic studies of channel
      offset along the Carrizo section of the south central San Andreas Fault assumed
      that channels form more frequently than earthquakes occur and suggested that
      repeated large-slip earthquakes similar to the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake
      illustrate typical fault behavior. We found that offset channels in the Carrizo
      Plain incised less frequently than they were offset by earthquakes. Channels have
      been offset by successive earthquakes with variable slip since ~1400. This
      nonuniform slip history reveals a more complex rupture history than previously
      assumed for the structurally simplest section of the San Andreas Fault.

AB  - Cone-like acryl converters have been used for transforming the
      energy-distribution information of incident fast neutrons into the
      spatial-distribution information of recoil protons. The characteristics of
      neutron-proton conversion have been studied up to around 10MeV by using an
      imaging plate (IP). A notable and interesting signal enhancement due to recoil
      protons generated in an acrylic converter was observed on IP images for
      irradiation with a 252Cf source. A Monte Carlo calculation was carried out in
      order to understand the spatial distributions of the signal enhancement by recoil
      protons; these distributions promisingly involve the energy information of
      incident neutrons in principle. Consequently, it has been revealed that the
      neutron energy evaluation is surely possible by analyzing the spatial
      distributions of signal enhancement that is caused by recoil protons.

TI  - Pregabalin in the treatment of chronic migraine: an open-label study.
PG  - 35-9
LID - 10.1097/WNF.0b013e3181bf1dbe [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Studies concerning the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine are
      scarce, with topiramate being the most thoroughly studied drug at this respect.
      The aim of our study was to assess if pregabalin could be useful in the
      preventive management of chronic migraine. METHODS: Thirty consecutive chronic
      migraine patients, 24 women and 6 men, aged 24 to 75 years and not receiving any 
      other prophylactic medication, were treated with pregabalin for 12 weeks. The
      initial daily dosage was 75 mg, subsequently adjusted according to the drug's
      efficacy and the individual patients' tolerability at 2-week intervals. Patients 
      kept a headache diary from 4 weeks before drug administration until the study
      ended, and headache impact test (HIT-6) was administered at baseline and at
      4-week intervals. The main outcome variable was the change from baseline to end
      point in headache frequency. The secondary outcome variables included changes in 
      headache severity, rescue medication intake, HIT-6 scores, and adverse reactions 
      to pregabalin. RESULTS: Pregabalin treatment was associated to significant
      decreases in headache frequency (P < 0.0001) and severity (P = 0.0005), rescue
      medication intake (P < 0.0001), and HIT-6 scores (P < 0.0001). Patients with
      daily headache performed worse than those with nondaily headache, showing no
      change in headache frequency and less relevant reduction of HIT-6 scores. The
      most frequent adverse reactions were dizziness (40%), somnolence (29%), abnormal 
      thinking (16.7%), constipation and fatigue (13.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the
      limitations of an open-label design, our data suggest that pregabalin may be a
      useful alternative prophylaxis for chronic migraine. These promising results
      should be confirmed in randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Influence of preoperative radiation field on postoperative leak rates in
      esophageal cancer patients after trimodality therapy.
PG  - 534-40
LID - 10.1097/JTO.0000000000000100 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Postoperative morbidities, such as anastomotic leaks, are common
      after trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery) for esophageal
      cancer. We investigated for factors associated with an increased incidence of
      anastomotic leaks. METHODS: Data from 285 esophageal cancer patients treated from
      2000 to 2011 with trimodality therapy were analyzed. Anastomotic location
      relative to preoperative radiation field was assessed using postoperative
      computed tomographic imaging. Logistic regression was used to evaluate for
      factors associated with any or clinically relevant (CR) (>/= grade 2) leaks.
      RESULTS: Overall anastomotic leak rate was 11% (31 of 285), and CR leak rate was 
      6% (17 of 285). Multivariable analysis identified body mass index (odds ratio
      [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.17; OR, 1.11, 95% CI,
      1.01-1.22), three-field surgery (OR, 10.01; 95% CI, 3.83-26.21; OR, 4.83; 95% CI,
      1.39-16.71), and within radiation field ("in-field") anastomosis (OR, 5.37; 95%
      CI, 2.21-13.04; OR, 8.63; 95% CI, 2.90-25.65) as independent predictors of both
      all grade and CR leaks, respectively. While patients with distal esophageal
      tumors and Ivor-Lewis surgery had the lowest incidence of all grade (6.5%) and CR
      leaks (4.2%), most of the leaks were associated with the anastomosis constructed 
      within the field of radiation (in-field: 39% and 30% versus out-of-field: 2.6%
      and 1.0%, respectively, for total and CR leaks, p less than 0.0001, Fisher's
      exact test). CONCLUSIONS: Esophagogastric anastomosis placed within the
      preoperative radiation field was a very strong predictor for anastomotic leaks in
      esophageal cancer patients treated with trimodality therapy, among other factors.
      Surgical planning should include a critical evaluation of the preoperative
      radiation fields to ensure proper anastomotic placement after chemoradiation
      therapy.

AB  - Atrazine (ATR) is an endocrine disruptor that affects steroidogenic process,
      resulting in disruption of reproductive function of the male and female gonads.
      In this study, we used the primary culture of peripubertal Leydig cells to
      investigate the effect of ATR on the rapid androgen production stimulated by
      human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). We demonstrated that ATR activated multiple
      signaling pathways enhancing the rapid hCG-stimulated androgen biosynthesis in
      Leydig cells. Low hCG concentration (0.25ng/mL) caused cAMP-independent, but
      ERK1/2-dependent increase in androgen production after 60min of incubation.
      Co-treatment with ATR for 60min enhanced the cAMP production in hCG-stimulated
      cells. Accumulation of androgens was prevented by addition of U0126,
      N-acetyl-l-cysteine and AG1478. Co-treatment with hCG and ATR for 60min did not
      alter steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star) mRNA level in Leydig cells.
      After 120min, hCG further increased androgenesis in Leydig cells that was
      sensitive to inhibition of the cAMP/PKA, ERK1/2 and ROS signaling pathways.
      Co-treatment with ATR for 120min further enhanced the hCG-induced androgen
      production, which was prevented by inhibition of the calcium, PKC and EGFR
      signaling cascades. After 120min, ATR enhanced the expression of Star mRNA in
      hCG-stimulated Leydig cells through activation of the PKA and PKC pathway.
      Collectively, these data suggest that exposure to ATR caused perturbations in
      multiple signaling pathways, thus enhancing the rapid hCG-dependent androgen
      biosynthesis in peripubertal Leydig cells.

TI  - Tumor cell-specific transcription of a murine histocompatibility class Ib Q5
      gene.
PG  - 3379-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that the Q5 gene product (Q5 antigen) was
      expressed on the surface of various tumor cells derived from H-2k (Qa-2-) mice.
      The Q5 antigen has tumor-protective antigenicity in the syngeneic mice. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Transcripts of the Qa region genes were analyzed by the RT-PCR
      method. Cell fractionation was performed with the MACS method and the phenotypes 
      were estimated by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Transcripts of Q5 were
      produced by all tumor cell lines. The Q5 transcription was detected only in
      thymocytes and PBMCs of H-2k (AKR and C3H/He) mice. The phenotype of the PBMCs in
      which Q5 transcription takes place seems to be, at least partly, CD3-48 cells
      that might be related to CD3-4-8- spontaneous thymoma cells derived from an H-2k 
      mouse. CONCLUSION: The expression of Q5 in tumor cells in general is a result of 
      a change of transcriptional regulation associated with malignant transformation.

TI  - Heterojunction modification for highly efficient organic-inorganic perovskite
      solar cells.
PG  - 12701-9
LID - 10.1021/nn505723h [doi]
AB  - Organic-inorganic perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X=I, Br, Cl), have emerged as 
      attractive absorber materials for the fabrication of low cost high efficiency
      solar cells. Over the last 3 years, there has been an exceptional rise in power
      conversion efficiencies (PCEs), demonstrating the outstanding potential of these 
      perovskite materials. However, in most device architectures, including the
      simplest thin-film planar structure, a current-voltage response displays an
      "anomalous hysteresis", whereby the power output of the cell varies with
      measurement time, direction and light exposure or bias history. Here we provide
      insight into the physical processes occurring at the interface between the n-type
      charge collection layer and the perovskite absorber. Through spectroscopic
      measurements, we find that electron transfer from the perovskite to the TiO2 in
      the standard planar junction cells is very slow. By modifying the n-type contact 
      with a self-assembled fullerene monolayer, electron transfer is "switched on",
      and both the n-type and p-type heterojunctions with the perovskite are active in 
      driving the photovoltaic operation. The fullerene-modified devices achieve up to 
      17.3% power conversion efficiency with significantly reduced hysteresis, and
      stabilized power output reaching 15.7% in the planar p-i-n heterojunction solar
      cells measured under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals, emerging environmental contaminants, have their ecotoxicological
      effects to non-target organisms in soil largely unknown. This study assessed
      short-term effects of two human pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine and fluoxetine, to
      Folsomia candida. Avoidance to spiked soils was assessed after 48 and 96 h
      exposure and biochemical changes (acetylcholinesterase and glutathione
      S-transferase activities, and lipid peroxidation levels) after 96 h. F. candida
      avoided soils spiked with 0.04, 0.4 and 4 mg carbamazepine kg(-1) after 48 h.
      However, higher number of organisms were found in soils with 40 mg carbamazepine 
      kg(-1), a behavior also displayed for 40 mg fluoxetine kg(-1) spiked soils. After
      96 h, F. candida showed avoidance behavior to soils with 4 and 40 mg
      carbamazepine kg(-1). Acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in 0.4 mg
      fluoxetine kg(-1) exposed organisms. Peroxidative damages were detected in
      organisms exposed to 4 and 40 mg kg(-1) carbamazepine and glutathione
      S-transferase inhibition was observed at 40 mg kg(-1). Data suggests that
      carbamazepine and fluoxetine may pose risk to soil collembolan.

AB  - Coronary artery injury such as acute coronary dissection is an uncommon and
      potentially life-threatening complication after blunt chest trauma. The authors
      report an unusual autopsy case of a 43-year-old healthy man who suddenly
      collapsed after receiving a punch to the chest during the practice of kung fu.
      The occurrence of the punch was supported by the presence of one recent contusion
      on the left lateral chest area at the external examination and by areas of
      hemorrhage next to the left lateral intercostal spaces at the internal
      examination. The histological examination revealed the presence of an acute
      dissection of the proximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary
      artery. Only few cases of coronary artery dissection have been reported due to
      trauma during sports activities such as rugby and soccer games, but never during 
      the practice of martial arts, sports usually considered as safe and responsible
      for only minor trauma.

AB  - A number of American nurses, on an individual basis, gave their assistance to
      European countries as soon as war was declared, in 1914. In 1917, when the United
      States entered the war, nurses from the American army arrived on the European
      continent before the troops. They made a major contribution to the conflict, as
      testified by the numerous medals they were awarded.

TI  - Behavioral and neural discrimination of speech sounds after moderate or intense
      noise exposure in rats.
PG  - e248-61

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hearing loss is a commonly experienced disability in a variety of
      populations including veterans and the elderly and can often cause significant
      impairment in the ability to understand spoken language. In this study, we tested
      the hypothesis that neural and behavioral responses to speech will be
      differentially impaired in an animal model after two forms of hearing loss.
      DESIGN: Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to one of two types of
      broadband noise which was either moderate or intense. In nine of these rats,
      auditory cortex recordings were taken 4 weeks after noise exposure (NE). The
      other seven were pretrained on a speech sound discrimination task prior to NE and
      were then tested on the same task after hearing loss. RESULTS: Following intense 
      NE, rats had few neural responses to speech stimuli. These rats were able to
      detect speech sounds but were no longer able to discriminate between speech
      sounds. Following moderate NE, rats had reorganized cortical maps and altered
      neural responses to speech stimuli but were still able to accurately discriminate
      between similar speech sounds during behavioral testing. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that rats are able to adjust to the neural changes after moderate
      NE and discriminate speech sounds, but they are not able to recover behavioral
      abilities after intense NE. Animal models could help clarify the adaptive and
      pathological neural changes that contribute to speech processing in
      hearing-impaired populations and could be used to test potential behavioral and
      pharmacological therapies.

LID - 10.1021/jo502801g [doi]
AB  - In an effort to develop reactivity-based dynamic covalent bonding and to expand
      the scope and application of the dynamic covalent chemistry, in situ-generated
      simple generic iminium ions were utilized for the dynamic covalent binding of
      monoalcohols with high affinity. Hammett analysis was conducted to manipulate the
      equilibrium and correlate with the reactivity of reactants. The structural
      features of aldehydes and secondary amines were identified, and both polar and
      steric effects have significant impact on the binding. In particular, the
      substrates which can participate in pi-pi and polar-pi interactions are able to
      afford apparent equilibrium constants in the magnitude of 10(4) M(-2),
      demonstrating the power of weak supramolecular forces to stabilize the dynamic
      covalent assembly. The generality of the assembly was validated with a series of 
      mono secondary alcohols. To showcase the practicality of our system, chirality
      discrimination and ee measurement of chiral secondary alcohols were achieved.

PG  - 500-3
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.09192.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and efficacy of transarterial
      embolization (TAE) in haemorrhagic urological emergencies, and to assess the
      perioperative morbidity, effect of timing of intervention on the requirement for 
      blood transfusion, and the long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between
      October 1997 and March 2009, 44 patients (30 men and 14 women; mean age 79 years,
      range 51-95) with intractable haematuria secondary to advanced pelvic tumour
      arising from or invading the bladder, underwent internal iliac TAE. Twenty-four
      patients had transitional carcinoma of the urinary bladder, 12 adenocarcinoma of 
      the prostate, five carcinoma of the uterus, one cancer of the vagina, two
      carcinoma of the rectum, three carcinoma of the kidney, two simultaneous
      carcinoma of prostate and bladder, one simultaneous carcinoma of prostate and
      kidney and one had haemorrhagic cystitis after radiotherapy. RESULTS: TAE of the 
      internal iliac arteries produced initial complete control of bleeding in 36 of
      the 44 patients (82%). At a mean (range) follow-up of 10.5 (1-97) months TAE
      there was permanent control of bleeding in 19 (43%) patients. A second TAE
      session was use in five (11%) patients and it was successful in two of them.
      There were 24 patients (55%) who required a mean of 4 (1-17) transfusion units
      before embolization; only 13 (30%) required more blood products after TAE. The
      mean haematocrit level before and after TAE was 27% and 31% (P < 0001), and the
      respective haemoglobin level were 8.7 and 10.3 g/dL (P < 0001). During the
      follow-up there were no major complications related to TAE; minor complications
      were post-TAE syndrome in 12 (27%) patients, fever (11%), gluteus pain (14%),
      nausea (2%), and exterior genital oedema (5%). The 6- and 12-month mortality
      rates were 66% (29 patients) and 18% (eight), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TAE
      should be considered as an alternative less-invasive palliative measure and the
      treatment of choice in these situations. TAE should always be bilateral, the
      catheter should advance distally to the origin of the superior gluteal artery and
      the artery embolized with unresorbable particles. Our study confirms the efficacy
      and safety of TAE in patients with pelvic malignancy, and indicates that this
      technique should be considered before surgery. The procedure combines the
      benefits of a minimally invasive approach in decreasing the cost of surgery and
      operating time, while maintaining low blood loss and analgesia requirement.

      6-chloro-2-(4'-iodophenyl)-3-(N,N-methylethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide 
      (CLINME) was radiolabelled with iodine-123 and assessed for its sensitivity for
      the TSPO in rodents. Moreover neuroinflammatory changes on a unilateral
      excitotoxic lesion rat model were detected using SPECT imaging. [(123)I]-CLINME
      was prepared in 70-80% radiochemical yield. The uptake of [(123)I]-CLINME was
      evaluated in rats by biodistribution, competition, and metabolite studies. The
      unilateral excitotoxic lesion was performed by injection of
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid unilaterally into the
      striatum. The striatum lesion was confirmed and correlated with TSPO expression
      in astrocytes and activated microglia by immunohistochemistry and
      autoradiography. In vivo studies with [(123)I]-CLINME indicated a biodistribution
      pattern consistent with TPSO distribution and the competition studies with
      PK11195 and Ro 5-4864 showed that [(123)I]-CLINME is selective for this site. The
      metabolite study showed that the extractable radioactivity was unchanged
      [(123)I]-CLINME in organs which expresses TSPO. SPECT/CT imaging on the
      unilateral excitotoxic lesion indicated that the mean ratio uptake in striatum
      (lesion:nonlesion) was 2.2. Moreover, TSPO changes observed by SPECT imaging were
      confirmed by immunofluorescence, immunochemistry, and autoradiography. These
      results indicated that [(123)I]-CLINME is a promising candidate for the
      quantification and visualization of TPSO expression in activated astroglia using 
      SPECT.

AB  - Most of the physiological processes are controlled by the small RNAs in several
      organisms including plants. A huge database exists on one type of small RNA,
      i.e., microRNAs (miRs) identified from diverse species. However, the processes of
      data-mining of miRs in most of the species are still incomplete. Rice feeds the
      hungry trillions and hence understanding its developmental processes as well as
      its stress biology, which might be largely controlled by the small RNA pathways, 
      is certainly a worthwhile task. Here, we report the cloning and identification of
      approximately 40 new putative miRs from local basmati rice variety in accordance 
      to the annotation suggested by Meyers et al. (Plant Cell 20:3186-3190, 2008).
      About 23 sequences were derived from rice exposed to salt stress while 18 were
      derived from rice infected with tungro virus. A few of these putative miRs were
      common to both. Our data showed that at least two of these miRs were up-regulated
      in response to both abiotic and biotic stresses. The miR target predictions
      indicate that most of the putative miRs target specific metabolic processes. The 
      up-regulation of similar miRs in response to two entirely different types of
      stresses suggests a converging functional role of miRs in managing various
      stresses. Our findings suggest that more rice miRs need to be identified and a
      thorough understanding of the function of such miRs will help unravel the
      mysteries of rice stress biology.

AB  - Monosex refers to the culture of either all-male or all-female populations, a
      sought after approach in aquaculture. This chapter reviews the advantages of
      monosex population culture and details the mechanisms to achieve it based on
      different modes of sex determination and sexual differentiation. A recent case
      study for an aquaculture biotechnology based on sexual manipulation in
      crustaceans serves in this chapter to identify the key elements for a successful 
      application. This application which makes use of RNA interference with a key
      regulating hormone opens the pathway toward environmentally friendly applications
      in fish and additional aquacultured species. This chapter portrays the state of
      the art in sexual manipulations in aquacultured species, starting with vertebrate
      species, followed by the case study of the crustacean species and discussion on
      how the techniques used in this study are applicable for other species.

TI  - Coevolution of the Toll-Like Receptor 4 Complex with Calgranulins and
      Lipopolysaccharide.
PG  - 304
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00304 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces inflammation in response to both pathogen-
      and host-derived molecules. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recognition by TLR4 has been
      shown to occur across the amniotes, but endogenous signaling through TLR4 has not
      been validated outside of placental mammals. To determine whether endogenous
      danger signaling is also shared across amniotes, we studied the evolution of
      TLR4-activation by the calgranulin proteins (S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12), a
      clade of host molecules that potently activate TLR4 in placental mammals. We
      performed phylogenetic and syntenic analysis and found MRP-126-a gene in birds
      and reptiles-is likely orthologous to the mammalian calgranulins. We then used an
      ex vivo TLR4 activation assay to establish that calgranulin pro-inflammatory
      activity is not specific to placental mammals, but is also exhibited by
      representative marsupial and sauropsid species. This activity is strongly
      dependent on the cofactors CD14 and MD-2 for all species studied, suggesting a
      conserved mode of activation across the amniotes. Ortholog complementation
      experiments between the calgranulins, TLR4, CD14, and MD-2 revealed extensive
      lineage specific-coevolution and multi-way interactions between components that
      are necessary for the activation of NF-kappaB signaling by calgranulins and LPS. 
      Our work demonstrates that calgranulin activation of TLR4 evolved at least ~320
      million years ago and has been conserved in the amniote innate immune system.

TI  - Magnetic resonance appearance of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the uterine
      cervix in comparison with that of usual-type endocervical adenocarcinoma: a
      pitfall of newly described unusual subtype of endocervical adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1474-9
LID - 10.1097/IGC.0000000000000229 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of
      gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS) of the uterine cervix, compared with usual-type
      endocervical adenocarcinoma (UEA) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), using
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15
      histopathologically defined GASs, 12 UEAs, and 40 SCCs were retrieved from
      archive files and were included for evaluation. Microscopic features, as well as 
      topography and tumor growth pattern, and presence or absence of coexistence of
      cystic cavities were evaluated. Accuracy of evaluation for parametrial tissue and
      vaginal wall invasion was also evaluated by 2 diagnostic radiologists,
      independently, without clinical information on cases. RESULTS: Thirteen (86.70%) 
      of the 15 cases of GAS exhibited tumors in the higher portion of cervical canal
      or the entire cervix. On the other hand, SCCs and UEAs were mainly located in the
      lower portion of cervical canal, at a frequency of 21 of 40 (52.5%) and 9 of 12
      (75.0%), respectively. Involvement of the corpus was observed more frequently in 
      cases of GAS with an occurrence of 8 of 15 (53.3%), whereas in all cases of UEA
      and in 5 of the 40 cases of SCC, the corpus was free of tumor. In GAS cases, the 
      predominant pattern of growth was highly infiltrating and endophytic (14/15,
      93.3%), whereas an exophytic growth pattern was observed in 31 (77.5%) of the 40 
      SCC cases and 11 (91.7%) of the 12 UEA cases. Cystic cavities associated with
      tumors were identified in only 1 case of SCC but occurred in 12 (80.0%) of the 15
      GASs and 4 (33.3%) of the 12 UEAs. Diagnostic accuracies of more than 70% and
      more than 60% were reached in parametrial invasion and vaginal invasion,
      respectively, in GAS. CONCLUSION: Distinctive MR imaging features of GAS were
      infiltrating mass of endophytic growth, location in the upper cervical canal, and
      association with tiny cysts. This characteristic appearance can be a clue for the
      evaluation of extent of tumor based on MR imaging.

PG  - 293-5
AB  - In a crystallized suspension of polystyrene spheres, the earth's gravitational
      field, acting on a vertical column of material several centimeters high, produces
      an elastic deformation that can be readily observed through its effect on the
      crystal lattice constant. This effect has been used to determine that Young's
      modulus for the crystalline material ranges from 1 to 3 dynes per square
      centimeter, depending on the concentration of spheres.

PG  - e0199912
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0199912 [doi]
AB  - OpenSim musculoskeletal models of the head and neck can provide information about
      muscle activity and the response of the head and neck to a variety of situations.
      Previous models report weak flexion strength, which is partially due to lacking
      moment generating capacity in the upper cervical spine. Previous models have also
      lacked realistic hyoid muscles, which have the capability to improve flexion
      strength and control in the upper cervical spine. Suprahyoid and infrahyoid
      muscles were incorporated in an OpenSim musculoskeletal model of the head and
      neck. This model was based on previous OpenSim models, and now includes hyoid
      muscles and passive elements. The moment generating capacity of the model was
      tested by simulating physical experiments in the OpenSim environment. The flexor 
      and extensor muscle strengths were scaled to match static experimental results.
      Models with and without hyoid muscles were used to simulate experimentally
      captured motions, and the need for reserve actuators was evaluated. The addition 
      of hyoid muscles greatly increased flexion strength, and the model is the first
      of its kind to have realistic strength values in all directions. Less reserve
      actuator moment was required to simulate real motions with the addition of hyoid 
      muscles. Several additional ways of improving flexion strength were investigated.
      Hyoid muscles add control and strength to OpenSim musculoskeletal models of the
      head and neck and improve simulations of head and neck movements.

TI  - Clinical Features of Hereditary Angioedema in Korean Patients: A Nationwide
      Multicenter Study.
PG  - 272-279
LID - 10.1159/000488350 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal 
      dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of nonpruritic, nonpitting 
      edema increasing after puberty. It can be fatal due to laryngeal or
      gastrointestinal (GI) involvement with varied and changing frequency of mortality
      according to studies published from the Western countries. Epidemiological and
      clinical data of HAE in Asian countries are sparse. We sought to examine the
      clinical characteristics of HAE patients in Korea. METHODS: Patients diagnosed
      with HAE at 15 tertiary hospitals across the country until 2016 were
      retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients diagnosed with HAE by
      2016 were identified. The prevalence of HAE was estimated at 1.3/1,000,000 in
      Korea. Of the 65 patients, 21 (32.3%) were males. A total of 90.8% patients had
      type I HAE, while the remaining 9.2% patients had type II HAE. The first symptom 
      developed after 20 years in 73.8% of patients, with a mean age 28.4 +/- 14.1
      years. The age at diagnosis was 36.5 +/- 15.8 years, with a mean time delay of
      7.8 +/- 10.5 years. While the face (82.3%) and extremities (upper 71.0%, lower
      62.9%) were the most frequently involved, the GI tract was affected in 40.5% of
      Korean HAE patients. Prophylaxis was maintained in 62.5% of patients. There was
      no reported case of death from HAE so far. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical
      manifestation and severity of HAE may vary according to ethnicity. HAE is more
      infrequent and GI involvement is less likely in Korea compared with Western
      countries.

TI  - Pediatric lateral sinus thrombosis: retrospective case series and literature
      review.
PG  - 79-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A comparison between the literature and our management of pediatric
      patients presenting with otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis. DESIGN: A
      retrospective case series of five pediatric patients. SETTING: Four patients were
      treated at BC Children's Hospital, whereas the fifth patient was treated in New
      Westminster, BC. All were treated between 1994 and 2001. METHODS: A retrospective
      chart review was conducted with a literature review for otogenic lateral sinus
      thrombosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment success was based on resolution of
      acute infection and neurologic symptoms. RESULTS: Five patients, four males and
      one female, aged 2 to 14 years were reviewed. Three patients were treated
      successfully without mastoidectomy. One patient received a mastoidectomy that
      yielded no pus or granulation tissue within the mastoid cavity. One patient
      required a mastoidectomy after failure to respond to bilateral myringotomy and
      tympanostomy tube insertion. Although no pus was seen in the mastoid cavity,
      perisinus pus was found after unroofing the sigmoid sinus plate; free flow of
      blood was obtained on needle aspiration of the sinus, and the sinus was not
      surgically opened. CONCLUSION: The current literature states that the management 
      of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis includes high-dose intravenous antibiotics
      with a mastoidectomy and possible opening of the sinus. In our retrospective case
      series, three of five patients recovered completely without mastoidectomy, and a 
      fourth had a mastoidectomy deemed to have been unnecessary. We conclude that
      intravenous antibiotics and insertion of a tympanostomy tube are sufficient
      treatment for selected cases of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis. Mastoidectomy 
      with possible opening of the sinus should be reserved for patients refractory to 
      the above conservative treatment.

AB  - This study analyzes the effects of the Rapha((R)) system, which employs red light
      therapy (RLT) and a natural latex biomembrane in the healing of neuropathic
      ulcers associated with the diabetic foot. We conducted a randomized, controlled, 
      blinded clinical trial with 15 participants that were divided into three groups
      (GI, GII and GIII): (i) Rapha((R)) system application by the participant and a
      health professional at home, with clinical status evaluation every 2 weeks at the
      hospital (GI); (ii) standard protocol used in Brazil, performed by a health
      professional at the hospital (GII; control); and (iii) the Rapha((R)) system
      applied by the participant at home and clinical status evaluation every 2 weeks
      at the hospital (GIII). We used image processing techniques on photographic
      recordings of the lesions, and several statistical tests were used to analyze the
      data, allowing for the comparison of the average results for all groups. The
      average healing rates of GI, GII, and GIII were 77.0, 51.4, and 80%,
      respectively. The granulation tissue evaluation indicated a higher efficacy in
      the tissue repair of lesions treated with the Rapha((R)) system. In conclusion,
      the Rapha((R)) system proved to be an effective healing system, even when
      self-applied at the patient's home.

TI  - Suppression of TGF-beta pathway by pirfenidone decreases extracellular matrix
      deposition in ocular fibroblasts in vitro.
PG  - e0172592
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0172592 [doi]
AB  - In glaucoma surgery, fibrotic processes occur, leading to impairment of liquid
      outflow. Activated fibroblasts are responsible for postoperative scarring. The
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway plays a key role in fibroblast
      function, differentiation and proliferation. The aim of this study was the
      characterization of the fibrotic potential of two subtypes of primary human
      ocular fibroblasts and the attempt to inhibit fibrotic processes specifically,
      without impairing cell viability. For fibrosis inhibition we focused on the small
      molecule pirfenidone, which has been shown to prevent pulmonary fibrosis by the
      decrease of the expression of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 cytokines. For
      in vitro examinations, isolated human primary fibroblasts from Tenon capsule and 
      human intraconal orbital fat tissues were used. These fibroblast subpopulations
      were analyzed in terms of the expression of matrix components responsible for
      postoperative scarring. We concentrated on the expression of collagen I, III, VI 
      and fibronectin. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of alpha-smooth muscle 
      actin, which serves as a marker for fibrosis and indicates transformation of
      fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Gene expression was analyzed by rtPCR and
      synthesized proteins were examined by immunofluorescence and Western blot
      methods. Proliferation of fibroblasts under different culture conditions was
      assessed using BrdU assay. TGF-beta1 induced a significant increase of cell
      proliferation in both cell types. Also the expression of some fibrotic markers
      was elevated. In contrast, pirfenidone decreased cell proliferation and matrix
      synthesis in both fibroblast subpopulations. Pirfenidone slightly attenuated
      TGF-beta1 induced expression of fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin in
      fibroblast cultures, without impairing cell viability. To summarize, manipulation
      of the TGF-beta signaling pathway by pirfenidone represents a specific
      antifibrotic approach with no toxic side effects in two human orbital fibroblast 
      subtypes. We presume that pirfenidone is a promising candidate for the treatment 
      of fibrosis following glaucoma surgery.

TI  - Frontal lobe seizures.
PG  - 125-35
LID - 10.1097/NRL.0b013e31821733db [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Frontal lobe epilepsy is the second most common
      localization-related or focal epilepsy. Frontal lobe seizures are challenging to 
      diagnose as the clinical manifestations are diverse due to the complexity and
      variability of the patterns of epileptic discharges, and the scalp
      electroencephalograph (EEG) can often be normal or misleading. This review
      focuses on the clinical and EEG features of seizures arising from the frontal
      lobe. REVIEW SUMMARY: The clinical manifestations in patients with frontal lobe
      epilepsy are varied. Frontal lobe seizures can be divided into perirolandic,
      supplementary sensorimotor area, dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, anterior
      frontopolar, opercular, and cingulate types. Seizures originating from the
      perirolandic and supplementary sensorimotor areas are clinically distinct,
      characterized by motor activity or asymmetric tonic posturing with preserved
      awareness. Seizures arising from dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, frontopolar, and
      cingulate areas are not as well characterized and have more variable clinical
      manifestations. Scalp EEG recording is sometimes helpful in localization but is
      usually normal or misleading in frontal lobe epilepsy. The treatment is similar
      to other localization-related or focal epilepsies. Medications are the first line
      of therapy, and surgery is considered for patients who fail to respond to
      medications. The surgical outcome in frontal lobe resections is less favorable
      than in anterior temporal lobectomies due to the challenge in locating the
      epileptogenic zone and the presence of functional areas (eloquent cortex) that
      can limit the resection. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal lobe seizures are characterized by 
      diverse behavioral manifestations. Only a few well-described frontal lobe
      syndromes exist. The variety of clinical manifestations reflects both the varying
      sites of seizure origin and propagation routes that seizures may take. Although
      this review provides a framework for the understanding of these seizures, one
      should remain cautious in diagnosing seizure localization based on clinical or
      EEG description. Only a few patients have well-described syndromes and can be
      diagnosed with confidence. For most patients, new diagnostic methods and genetic 
      testing may help improve our ability to diagnose and treat the conditions
      discussed in this study.

TI  - Increased concentrations of antibody-bound circulatory cell-free DNA in
      rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1609-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased concentrations of cell-free DNA have been found in several 
      disorders and have been interpreted as evidence of increased rates of cell death 
      or turnover. Evidence from in vitro and animal experiments suggests that DNA may 
      play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We
      measured cell-free DNA in plasma and serum from patients with RA and healthy
      controls by use of quantitative PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
      (GAPDH) DNA. We used protein G Sepharosetrade mark bead adsorption of plasma and 
      elution to isolate antibody-bound DNA. RESULTS: In paired plasma and serum
      samples of 16 healthy controls the median GAPDH copies were 4500 genome
      equivalents (GE)/mL plasma (range 319-21 000) and in 26 RA patients 17 000 GE/mL 
      plasma (2100-2 375 000, P = 0.0001). In the serum from normal controls the median
      GAPDH copies were 35 000 GE/mL (1700-239 000) and from RA patients 222 000 GE/mL 
      (21 000-2 375 000, P = 0.004). A median of 81% of the cell-free DNA in RA was
      associated with antibody compared with 9% in healthy controls (P = 0.001). The
      concentrations of DNA did not vary with the type of therapy patients received.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new evidence for a role of cell-free
      DNA-antibody complexes in the etiology of RA, suggest new avenues for basic
      research, and may prove to be relevant to diagnosis and assessment of therapy.

TI  - Atomic-Scale Explanation of O2 Activation at the Au-TiO2 Interface.
PG  - 18082-18092
LID - 10.1021/jacs.8b10929 [doi]
AB  - By a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,
      finite-temperature ab initio simulations, and electronic structure analyses, the 
      activation of molecular dioxygen at the interface of gold nanoparticles and
      titania in Au/TiO2 catalysts is explained at the atomic scale by tracing
      processes down to the molecular orbital picture. Direct evidence is provided that
      excess electrons in TiO2, for example created by photoexcitation of the
      semiconductor, migrate to the gold particles and from there to oxygen molecules
      adsorbed at gold/titania perimeter sites. Superoxide species are formed more
      efficiently in this way than on the bare TiO2 surface. This catalytic effect of
      the gold nanoparticles is attributed to a weakening of the internal O-O bond,
      leading to a preferential splitting of the molecule at shorter bond lengths
      together with a 70% decrease of the dissociation free energy barrier compared to 
      the non-catalyzed case on bare TiO2. The findings are an important step forward
      in the clarification of the role of gold in (photo)catalytic processes.

TI  - Spitz nevi: beliefs, behaviors, and experiences of pediatric dermatologists.
PG  - 283-91
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.1124 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Controversy exists regarding strategies for diagnosis and management 
      of Spitz nevi, a type of melanocytic neoplasm that most often develops in
      children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the beliefs, behaviors, and experiences of
      pediatric dermatologists with regard to Spitz nevi. DESIGN: Anonymous web-based
      survey. SETTING: Private and academic dermatology practices. PARTICIPANTS:
      Respondents included 175 pediatric dermatologists from the United States and
      around the world, representing a 51.1% response rate (175 of 342). Analyses were 
      limited to the 144 respondents whose practices included at least 50% children
      (younger than 18 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of the following with 
      regard to Spitz nevi: frequency of diagnosis, general beliefs, techniques used
      for evaluation (eg, dermoscopy and biopsy), management strategies, and observed
      outcomes. RESULTS: Collectively, respondents had seen approximately 20 000 Spitz 
      nevi; 67.6% (96 of 142) had diagnosed at least 6 Spitz nevi yearly, whereas 90.1%
      (128 of 142) had diagnosed no more than 2 prepubertal melanomas in the past 5
      years. Ninety-six percent of respondents (95.8%; 136 of 142) categorized typical 
      Spitz nevi as benign. Eighty percent of respondents (79.6%; 113 of 142) used
      dermatoscopy, and 96.5% (137 of 142) avoided partial biopsies of Spitz nevi. In
      children with a suspected Spitz nevus, clinical follow-up was chosen by 49.3% (69
      of 140) of respondents for a small, stable nonpigmented lesion and by 29.7% (41
      of 138) for a pigmented lesion with a typical starburst pattern seen via
      dermatoscopy. Predictors of clinical follow-up of the latter lesion included
      believing that Spitz nevi are not melanoma precursors (P = .04). Forty-seven
      percent (62 of 132) of respondents had observed involution of Spitz nevi. No
      deaths had resulted from the approximately 10 000 Spitz nevi or atypical spitzoid
      neoplasms seen by the 91 respondents with academic or hospital-based practices.
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of our survey support conservative
      management of Spitz nevi in children, with clinical follow-up representing an
      option for typical lesions. This represents an important difference from
      strategies used for management of these lesions in adults.

TI  - Female gender is a social determinant of diabetes in the Caribbean: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e0126799
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126799 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes (DM) is estimated to affect 10-15% of the adult population
      in the Caribbean. Preventive efforts require population wide measures to address 
      its social determinants. We undertook a systematic review to determine current
      knowledge about the social distribution of diabetes, its risk factors and major
      complications in the Caribbean. This paper describes our findings on the
      distribution by gender. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and five databases
      through the Virtual Health Library, for Caribbean studies published between 2007 
      and 2013 that described the distribution by gender for: known risk factors for
      Type 2 DM, prevalence of DM, and DM control or complications. PRISMA guidance on 
      reporting systematic reviews on health equity was followed. Only quantitative
      studies (n>50) were included; each was assessed for risk of bias. Meta-analyses
      were performed, where appropriate, on studies with a low or medium risk of bias, 
      using random effects models. RESULTS: We found 50 articles from 27 studies,
      yielding 118 relationships between gender and the outcomes. Women were more
      likely to have DM, obesity, be less physically active but less likely to smoke.
      In meta-analyses of good quality population-based studies odds ratios for women
      vs. men for DM, obesity and smoking were: 1.65 (95% CI 1.43, 1.91), 3.10 (2.43,
      3.94), and 0.24 (0.17, 0.34). Three studies found men more likely to have better 
      glycaemic control but only one achieved statistical significance. CONCLUSION AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Female gender is a determinant of DM prevalence in the Caribbean.
      In the vast majority of world regions women are at a similar or lower risk of
      type 2 diabetes than men, even when obesity is higher in women. Caribbean female 
      excess of diabetes may be due to a much greater excess of risk factors in women, 
      especially obesity. These findings have major implications for preventive
      policies and research.

TI  - Pros and cons of using the Mental Health Act for severe eating disorders in
      adolescents.
PG  - 14-23
LID - 10.1002/erv.887 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In England and Wales the compulsory treatment of young people with
      severe eating disorders is controversial. There is a concern that such treatment 
      may impair patient autonomy and negatively influence the outcome. In this study, 
      based in a specialist hospital, we compared patients treated under parental
      consent with those detained under the Mental Health Act: their characteristics
      and outcome up to 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: 34 patients were informal
      (treated under parental consent) (age: 16.2 +/- 1.3 years) and 16 were treated
      under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act (age: 16.2 +/- 1) in a 3-year period.
      Detained patients had an earlier age of onset (12.2 +/- 5 vs. 14.3 +/- 1.8) and
      more previous hospitalisation. On admission, their psychosocial functioning
      (Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS): 13.6 +/- 2 vs. 26.9 +/- 9; Health of
      the Nation Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents (HONOSCA): 41.7 +/- 5 vs.
      31.9 +/- 5) were worse than voluntary patients', they had a higher level of
      co-morbid depression (BDI: 38.1 +/- 15.6 vs. 26.6 +/- 12.4) and a higher rate of 
      suicidal behaviour. All physical and psychosocial measures improved substantially
      and clinically significantly by discharge and there was no statistically
      significant difference at this stage between the two patient groups. Two informal
      patients died within a year after discharge (6.3%), but there were no deaths
      amongst the detained patients. COMMENTS: In contrast with previous findings in
      adults, the outcome for detained patients was similar to that for informal
      patients, despite the former having more severe presentation on admission. There 
      was no evidence of higher mortality in the detained group.

TI  - The rising tide of cholecystectomy for biliary dyskinesia.
PG  - 98-106
LID - 10.1111/apt.12105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expert consensus defines biliary dyskinesia as a rare disorder of the
      gall-bladder characterised by pain and impaired gall-bladder function. AIM: To
      determine trends in cholecystectomy rates for biliary dyskinesia in the United
      States. METHODS: As biliary dyskinesia does not have a distinct diagnosis code,
      the narrative diagnoses for patients were reviewed and abstracted for 200
      patients treated for the most commonly used diagnosis codes for biliary
      dyskinesia (validation sample). Time trends in cholecystectomies and
      hospitalisations for biliary diseases were assessed using the Nationwide
      Inpatient Sample (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) based on codes for 
      cholecystectomy and diagnosis codes for different biliary disorders. RESULTS: In 
      the validation sample, biliary dyskinesia accounted for 81% of the patients with 
      ICD-9 code 575.8 (gall-bladder disease not elsewhere specified). Between 1997 and
      2010, admissions for acute cholecystitis and complications of gallstone disease
      decreased slightly, whereas admissions with the primary diagnosis code ICD-9
      575.8 tripled. This rise was most pronounced in the paediatric population (700%
      increase), with biliary dyskinesia accounting for more than 10% of
      cholecystectomies. Compared with acute biliary diseases, significantly more of
      the elective hospitalisations were covered by private insurances. CONCLUSIONS:
      Practice patterns differ from expert opinion, with biliary dyskinesia accounting 
      for an increasing fraction of cholecystectomies. The rise in these elective
      interventions is associated with a shift to a younger, low risk and predominantly
      privately insured population. Considering the benign nature of biliary
      dyskinesia, it is time to reassess the need for operative interventions, which
      have never been compared with active conservative therapy.

TI  - Plasticity of hypothalamic dopamine neurons during lactation results in
      dissociation of electrical activity and release.
PG  - 4424-33
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4415-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - Tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons are the central regulators of
      prolactin (PRL) secretion. Their extensive functional plasticity allows a change 
      from low PRL secretion in the non-pregnant state to the condition of
      hyperprolactinemia that characterizes lactation. To allow this rise in PRL, TIDA 
      neurons are thought to become unresponsive to PRL at lactation and functionally
      silenced. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, the electrical properties 
      of the system were not modified during lactation and that the neurons remained
      electrically responsive to a PRL stimulus, with PRL inducing an acute increase in
      their firing rate during lactation that was identical to that seen in
      non-pregnant mice. Furthermore, we show a long-term organization of TIDA neuron
      electrical activity with an harmonization of their firing rates, which remains
      intact during lactation. However, PRL-induced secretion of dopamine (DA) at the
      median eminence was strongly blunted during lactation, at least in part
      attributable to lack of phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the key enzyme
      involved in DA synthesis. We therefore conclude that lactation, rather than
      involving electrical silencing of TIDA neurons, represents a condition of
      decoupling between electrical activity at the cell body and DA secretion at the
      median eminence.

TI  - Solubilization of Genistein in Phospholipid Vesicles and Their Atioxidant
      Capacity.
PG  - 61-66
LID - 10.5650/jos.ess18181 [doi]
AB  - Water-insoluble genistein was solubilized in aqueous medium by using phospholipid
      vesicles composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and
      1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (DOPC) with 0-30% cholesterol. For each
      vesicle, the maximum solubilization amount of genistein was investigated by X-ray
      scattering measurement. In addition, the antioxidant capacity of the solubilized 
      genistein was evaluated by the ABTS assay. Genistein was found to be solubilized 
      by 10-20% and 40-50% of the vesicle concentrations of pure DPPC and DOPC
      respectively. The maximum solubilization amount of genistein decreased to 0-10%
      and 20-30% when 30% of cholesterol is present in the respective vesicles.
      Cholesterol is solubilized in a hydrophobic core whereas genistein is solubilized
      in the polar head region or in the polar-apolar interface. The overlapping of
      solubilizing sites affected the solubilization of genistein when cholesterol was 
      present in the vesicles. Moreover, the lamellar interval was largely affected by 
      cholesterol in compared to the little impact of genistein because the later can
      indirectly affect the acyl chains. Genistein solubilized in DOPC showed the same 
      degree of antioxidant capacity as that of vesicle-free genistein system. On the
      other hand, genistein solubilized in DPPC had lower antioxidant activity than the
      former systems. The distinction of antioxidant activity at different systems
      probably related to the difference of accessibility of ABTS radical cation to
      solubilized genistein through different vesicles. Finally, cholesterol-free DOPC 
      vesicles were found to be the best solubilizer for genistein among the
      investigated systems.

PG  - e5815
LID - 10.7717/peerj.5815 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), two late
      onset neurodegenerative diseases, have been shown to share overlapping cellular
      pathologies and genetic origins. Studies suggest that a hexanucleotide repeat
      expansion in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene is the most common cause of
      familial FTD and ALS pathology. The C9orf72 protein is predicted to be a
      differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells domain protein implying
      that C9orf72 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to regulate 
      specific Rab GTPases. Reported studies thus far point to a putative role for
      C9orf72 in lysosome biogenesis, vesicular trafficking, autophagy and mechanistic 
      target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) signaling. Here we report the expression,
      purification and biochemical characterization of C9orf72 protein. We conclusively
      show that C9orf72 is a GEF. The distinctive presence of both Rab- and Rho-GTPase 
      GEF activities suggests that C9orf72 may function as a dual exchange factor
      coupling physiological functions such as cytoskeleton modulation and autophagy
      with endocytosis.

TI  - Re-irradiation for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM): a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 79-90
LID - 10.1007/s11060-018-03064-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and toxicity of re-irradiation for patients
      with recurrent GBM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched various biomedical
      databases from 1998 to 2018, for eligible studies where patients were treated
      with re-irradiation for recurrent GBM. Outcomes of interest were 6 and 12-month
      overall survival (OS-6, OS-12), 6 and 12-month progression free survival (PFS-6, 
      PFS-12) and serious (Grade 3 +) adverse events (AE). We used the random effects
      model to pool outcomes across studies and compared pre-defined subgroups using
      interaction test. Methodological quality of each study was assessed using the
      Newcastle-Ottawa scoring system. RESULTS: We found 50 eligible non-comparative
      studies including 2095 patients. Of these, 42% were of good or fair quality. The 
      pooled results were as follows: OS-6 rate 73% (95% confidence interval (CI)
      69-77%), OS-12 rate 36% (95% CI 32-40%), PFS-6 rate 43% (95% CI 35-50%), PFS-12
      rate 17% (95% CI 13-20%), and Grade 3 + AE rate 7% (95% CI 4-10%). Subgroup
      analysis showed that prospective studies reported higher toxicity rates, and
      studies which utilized brachytherapy to have a longer OS-12. Within the external 
      beam radiotherapy group, there was no dose-response [above or below 36 Gy in 2 Gy
      equivalent doses (EQD2)]. However, a short fractionation regimen (</= 5
      fractions) seemed to provide superior PFS-6. CONCLUSION: The available evidence, 
      albeit mostly level III, suggests that re-irradiation provides encouraging
      disease control and survival rates. Toxicity was not uniformly reported, but
      seemed to be low from the included studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCT)
      are needed to establish the optimal management strategy for recurrent GBM.

TI  - In vivo induction of human cytochrome P450 3A4 by rifabutin in chimeric mice with
      humanized liver.
PG  - 863-75
AB  - The induction of human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) often poses a serious
      problem in clinical practice. The induction of CYP3A leads to a decrease in the
      pharmacological potency of drugs, since many drugs are substrates of CYP3A. The
      present study examined the in vivo induction potency of human CYP3A in chimeric
      mice with humanized liver, recently established in Japan, by a specific inducer
      of human CYP3A enzyme activity in this experimental condition, rifabutin, which
      is an analogue of rifampicin. The chimeric mice were treated intraperitoneally
      daily for 4 days with rifabutin (50 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). The mRNA, protein and
      enzyme activity in liver of the chimeric mice were measured by
      reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis and
      high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. In the chimeric mice, the
      human CYP3A4 mRNA expression, CYP3A4 protein content, testosterone
      6ss-hydroxylase activity and dexamethasone 6-hydroxylase activity were increased 
      7.4-, 3.0-, 2.4- and 1.9-fold, respectively, by treatment with rifabutin. The
      mRNA expression of other human CYPs, transporters and nuclear receptors was not
      significantly changed by rifabutin. On the other hand, rifabutin was demonstrated
      not to increase the murine Cyp3a enzyme activities in the control mice. It was
      demonstrated that human CYP3A4 expressed in the chimeric mice with humanized
      liver was induced by rifabutin, suggesting that human CYP3A4 in the chimeric mice
      had induction potency. This chimeric mouse model may be a useful animal model to 
      estimate and predict the in vivo induction of CYPs in human.

AB  - Marine mammals (bowhead whale, walrus, and various seals) constitute the major
      component of the diet of the Yupik people of St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. St.
      Lawrence Island residents have higher serum concentrations of polychlorinated
      biphenyls (PCB) than in the general U.S. population. In order to determine
      potential sources, traditional food samples were collected from 2004 to 2009 and 
      analyzed for PCBs, three chlorinated pesticides, and seven heavy metals (mercury,
      copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, cadmium, and lead). Concentrations of PCB in
      rendered oils (193-421 ppb) and blubber (73-317 ppb) from all marine mammal
      samples were at levels that trigger advisories for severely restricted
      consumption, using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fish consumption
      advisories. Concentrations of pesticides were lower, but were still elevated. The
      highest PCB concentrations were found in polar bear (445 ppb) and the lowest in
      reindeer adipose tissue (2 ppb). Marine mammal and polar bear meat in general
      have PCB concentrations that were 1-5% of those in rendered oils or adipose
      tissue. PCB concentrations in organs were higher than meat. Concentrations of
      metals in oils and meats from all species were relatively low, but increased
      levels of mercury, cadmium, copper, and zinc were present in some liver and
      kidney samples. Mercury and arsenic were found in lipid-rich samples, indicating 
      organometals. These results show that the source of the elevated concentrations
      of these contaminants in the Yupik population is primarily from consumption of
      marine mammal blubber and rendered oils.

TI  - Immunogenicity and safety of the candidate RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in young Nigerian
      children: a randomized, double-blind, lot-to-lot consistency trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For regulatory approval, consistency in manufacturing of vaccine lots
      is expected to be demonstrated in confirmatory immunogenicity studies using
      two-sided equivalence trials. This randomized, double-blind study (NCT01323972)
      assessed consistency of three RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine batches formulated from 
      commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots in terms of anti-CS-responses
      induced. METHODS: Healthy children aged 5-17 months were randomized (1:1:1:1) to 
      receive RTS,S/AS01 at 0-1-2 months from one of three commercial-scale purified
      antigen bulk lots (1600 litres-fermentation scale; commercial-scale lots), or a
      comparator vaccine batch made from pilot-scale purified antigen bulk lot (20
      litres-fermentation scale; pilot-scale lot). The co-primary objectives were to
      first demonstrate consistency of antibody responses against circumsporozoite (CS)
      protein at one month post-dose 3 for the three commercial-scale lots and second
      demonstrate non-inferiority of anti-CS antibody responses at one month post-dose 
      3 for the commercial-scale lots compared to the pilot-scale lot. Safety and
      reactogenicity were evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: One month
      post-dose-3, anti-CS antibody geometric mean titres (GMT) for the 3 commercial
      scale lots were 319.6 EU/ml (95% confidence interval (CI): 268.9-379.8), 241.4
      EU/ml (207.6-280.7), and 302.3 EU/ml (259.4-352.3). Consistency for the
      RTS,S/AS01 commercial-scale lots was demonstrated as the two-sided 95% CI of the 
      anti-CS antibody GMT ratio between each pair of lots was within the range of
      0.5-2.0. GMT of the pooled commercial-scale lots (285.8 EU/ml (260.7-313.3)) was 
      non-inferior to the pilot-scale lot (271.7 EU/ml (228.5-323.1)). Each RTS,S/AS01 
      lot had an acceptable tolerability profile, with infrequent reports of grade 3
      solicited symptoms. No safety signals were identified and no serious adverse
      events were considered related to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: RTS,S/AS01 lots
      formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk batches induced a
      consistent anti-CS antibody response, and the anti-CS GMT of pooled
      commercial-scale lots was non-inferior to that of a lot formulated from a
      pilot-scale antigen bulk batch.

AB  - Skin cancer is among one of the most common human malignancies wide-spread
      world-over with mortality statistics rising continuously at an alarming rate. The
      increasing frequency of these malignancies has marked the need for adopting
      effective treatment plan coupled with better and site-specific delivery options
      for the desired therapeutic agent's availability at the affected site. The
      concurrent delivery approaches to cancerous tissues are under constant challenge 
      and, as a result, are evolving and gaining advancements in terms of delivery
      modes, therapeutic agents and site-specificity of the therapeutics delivery. The 
      lipid-based liposomal drug delivery is an attractive and emerging option, and
      which is meticulously shaping up beyond a threshold level to a promising, and
      viable route for the effective delivery of therapeutic agents and other required 
      injuctions to the skin cancer. An update on liposomal delivery of
      chemotherapeutic agents, natural-origin compounds, photosensitizer, and DNA
      repair enzymes as well as other desirable and typical delivery modes employed in 
      drug delivery and in the treatment of skin cancers is discussed in details.
      Moreover, liposomal delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutics, i.e., small
      interfering RNA (siRNA), mRNA therapy, and RGD-linked liposomes are among the
      other promising novel technology under constant development. The current clinical
      applicability, viable clinical plans, future prospects including transport
      feasibility of delivery vesicles and imaging techniques in conjunction with the
      therapeutic agents is also discussed. The ongoing innovations in liposomal drug
      delivery technology for skin cancers hold promise for further development of the 
      methodology for better, more effective and site-specific delivery as part of the 
      better treatment plan by ensuring faster drug transport, better and full payload 
      delivery with enough and required concentration of the dose.

TI  - Novel hybrid materials of magnetic nanoparticles and cellulose fibers.
PG  - 122-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jcis.2008.11.038 [doi]
AB  - In this study, magnetic cellulose fibers have been prepared by coating bleached
      Kraft fibers (Pinus radiata) with magnetite nanoparticles. In doing so, the
      inherent properties of the fiber (such as tensile strength and flexibility) have 
      been preserved, but imparted to it are the magnetic properties of the coating.
      The surface coating approach used differs from other methods in the literature in
      which the lumen loading or in situ approach is taken. After successive washings
      and sonication, the particles remained bonded to the surface of the fiber, and
      the fibers could be formed into a paper sheet. The chemical and physical
      characterization of these materials were carried out using scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM), electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence
      spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
      (XPS), and SQUID magnetometry. SEM shows the surface of the fibers to be
      completely encapsulated by the ferrite nanoparticles. This is also confirmed by
      EDS. XRD line broadening analysis shows the average particle sizes of the
      nanoparticles range from 12-26 nm. Magnetically responsive cellulose fibers such 
      as those synthesized in this study, will allow the investigation of new concepts 
      in papermaking and packaging, security paper, and information storage. Potential 
      applications are in electromagnetic shielding, magnetographic printing and
      magnetic filtering.

TI  - Complete thoracoscopic lobectomy for cancer: comparative study of
      three-dimensional high-definition with two-dimensional high-definition video
      systems dagger.
PG  - 820-3
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivv031 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Common video systems for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)
      provide the surgeon a two-dimensional (2D) image. This study aimed to evaluate
      performances of a new three-dimensional high definition (3D-HD) system in
      comparison with a two-dimensional high definition (2D-HD) system when conducting 
      a complete thoracoscopic lobectomy (CTL). METHODS: This multi-institutional
      comparative study trialled two video systems: 2D-HD and 3D-HD video systems used 
      to conduct the same type of CTL. The inclusion criteria were T1N0M0
      non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in the left lower lobe and suitable for
      thoracoscopic resection. The CTL was performed by the same surgeon using either a
      3D-HD or 2D-HD system. Eighteen patients with NSCLC were included in the study
      between January and December 2013: 14 males, 4 females, with a median age of 65.6
      years (range: 49-81). The patients were randomized before inclusion into two
      groups: to undergo surgery with the use of a 2D-HD or 3D-HD system. We compared
      operating time, the drainage duration, hospital stay and the N upstaging rate
      from the definitive histology. RESULTS: The use of the 3D-HD system significantly
      reduced the surgical time (by 17%). However, chest-tube drainage, hospital stay, 
      the number of lymph-node stations and upstaging were similar in both groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The main finding was that 3D-HD system significantly reduced the
      surgical time needed to complete the lobectomy. Thus, future integration of 3D-HD
      systems should improve thoracoscopic surgery, and enable more complex resections 
      to be performed. It will also help advance the field of endoscopically assisted
      surgery.

TI  - Transplant in a patient with comorbid psychiatric illness: an ethical dilemma.
PG  - 40-4
AB  - This article addresses a difficult ethical dilemma that transplant surgeons may
      potentially encounter: whether a patient with a psychiatric illness is a good
      candidate for a liver transplant. This case study illustrates the challenges
      involved when considering the ethical principles of patient self-determination,
      distributive justice of scarce medical resources, "social worth," and protection 
      of vulnerable patient populations. Are patients with psychiatric illness able to 
      provide consent for transplantation? Is it possible to avoid misallocating
      valuable donor organs and, at the same time, fairly allocate these resources?
      This article seeks to answer these questions and provide insight into this
      ethical dilemma.

AB  - The hepatitis C virus infection system represents an important new tool for drug 
      discovery. In this study, we compared the in vitro antiviral efficacy of several 
      NS3 and NS5B inhibitors in genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a replicons and in the 2a
      infectious virus system. The nucleoside inhibitor 2'-C-methyl adenosine showed
      similar efficacy in each system tested. Three non-nucleoside inhibitors had small
      differences in potency between genotype 1a and 1b. In contrast, there was a
      dramatic loss of potency for these non-nucleoside inhibitors in the genotype 2a
      replicon, 2a infectious virus, and 2a NS5B biochemical assays. The protease
      inhibitor BILN-2061 had similar efficacy against 1a and 1b replicons but was
      61-109-fold less potent against the 2a replicon and virus, respectively. VX-950, 
      a covalent protease inhibitor, had similar efficacy (<3-fold changes in EC(50))
      regardless of genotype or subtype. Importantly, we observed a significant
      correlation (p<0.0001) in antiviral potency between the 2a replicon and 2a
      infectious virus for all classes of compounds tested.

AB  - Electrothermal atomization of beryllium from graphite and tungsten surfaces was
      compared with and without the use of various chemical modifiers. Tungsten proved 
      to be the best substrate, giving the more sensitive integrated atomic absorption 
      signals of beryllium. Tungsten platform atomization with zirconium as a chemical 
      modifier was used for the determination of beryllium in several NIST SRM
      certified reference samples, with good agreement obtained between the results
      found and the certified values. The precision of the measurements (at 10
      microgL(-1)), the limit of detection (3sigma), and the characteristic mass of
      beryllium were 2.50%, 0.009 microgL(-1) and 0.42 pg, respectively.

TI  - Dosage compensation in the mouse balances up-regulation and silencing of X-linked
      genes.
PG  - e326
AB  - Dosage compensation in mammals involves silencing of one X chromosome in XX
      females and requires expression, in cis, of Xist RNA. The X to be inactivated is 
      randomly chosen in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) at the blastocyst stage of 
      development. Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the ICM of female mice have
      two active X chromosomes, one of which is inactivated as the cells differentiate 
      in culture, providing a powerful model system to study the dynamics of X
      inactivation. Using microarrays to assay expression of X-linked genes in
      undifferentiated female and male mouse ES cells, we detect global up-regulation
      of expression (1.4- to 1.6-fold) from the active X chromosomes, relative to
      autosomes. We show a similar up-regulation in ICM from male blastocysts grown in 
      culture. In male ES cells, up-regulation reaches 2-fold after 2-3 weeks of
      differentiation, thereby balancing expression between the single X and the
      diploid autosomes. We show that silencing of X-linked genes in female ES cells
      occurs on a gene-by-gene basis throughout differentiation, with some genes
      inactivating early, others late, and some escaping altogether. Surprisingly, by
      allele-specific analysis in hybrid ES cells, we also identified a subgroup of
      genes that are silenced in undifferentiated cells. We propose that X-linked genes
      are silenced in female ES cells by spreading of Xist RNA through the X chromosome
      territory as the cells differentiate, with silencing times for individual genes
      dependent on their proximity to the Xist locus.

AB  - Implementation science in mental health is informed by other academic disciplines
      and industries. Conceptual and methodological territory charted in psychotherapy 
      research is pertinent to two elements of the conceptual model of implementation
      posited by Aarons and colleagues (2010)--implementation fidelity and innovation
      feedback systems. Key characteristics of scientifically validated fidelity
      instruments, and of the feasibility of their use in routine care, are presented. 
      The challenges of ensuring fidelity measurement methods are both effective
      (scientifically validated) and efficient (feasible and useful in routine care)
      are identified as are examples of implementation research attempting to balance
      these attributes of fidelity measurement.

TI  - Two glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors attenuate doxorubicin-induced
      p21Cip1/Waf1 upregulation in HepG2 cells, irrespective of their differential
      chemosensitizing properties.
PG  - 242-6
AB  - We have previously reported that HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells are sensitized
      to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor
      d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) but not by the 
      more specific inhibitor
      d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (PPPP). Herein we
      investigated whether the chemosensitizing action of PDMP impinged on any
      unspecific effect of this compound on doxorubicin-induced expression of p53
      and/or p21(Cip1/Waf1), namely two proteins reported to modulate the apoptotic
      response to DNA-damaging agents, in a positive or negative fashion, respectively.
      We show that, in HepG2 cells, PDMP did not substantially affect
      doxorubicin-induced p53 upregulation, whereas drug-evoked upregulation of
      p21(Cip1/Waf1) was markedly attenuated. Although this outcome could be expected
      to account for the chemosensitizing effect of PDMP, impaired upregulation of
      p21(Cip1/Waf1), in the setting of unaltered p53 expression, was also observed in 
      the case of PPPP. These results, while raising the possibility of a link between 
      attenuation of drug-evoked p21(Cip1/Waf1) expression and redirection of
      (glyco)sphingolipid metabolism, show that, differently from other tumor systems, 
      attenuation of doxorubicin-induced p21(Cip1/Waf1) expression is at least not
      sufficient to sensitize HepG2 cells to the apoptotic action of the drug.

TI  - Pulmonary measles disease: old and new imaging tools.
PG  - 935-943
LID - 10.1007/s11547-018-0919-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measles virus can cause lower respiratory tract infection, so that
      chest radiography is necessary to investigate lung involvement in patients with
      respiratory distress. PURPOSE: To assess measles pneumonia imaging during the
      measles outbreak occurred in 2016-2017 in Italy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We
      retrospectively observed adult patients with a serological diagnosis of measles, 
      who underwent chest-X rays for suspected pneumonia. If a normal radiography
      resulted, the patient underwent unenhanced CT. A CT post processing software
      package was used for an additional quantitative lung and airway involvement
      analysis . RESULTS: Among 290 patients affected by measles, 150 underwent chest-X
      ray. Traditional imaging allowed the pneumonia diagnosis in 114 patients (76%).
      The most frequent abnormality at chest X-rays was bronchial wall thickening,
      observed in 88.5% of the cases; radiological findings are faint in the 25% of the
      cases (29/114 patients). In nine subjects with a normal chest X-ray, unenhanced
      CT with a quantitative analysis was performed, and depicted features consistent
      with constrictive bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION: Measles may produce bronchiolitis
      and pneumonia. In the cases in which involvement of pulmonary parenchyma is not
      sufficient to result in radiological abnormalities, CT used with a dedicated
      postprocessing software package, provides an accurate lungs and airways analysis,
      also determining the percentage of lung involvement.

      marker for cancer stem cell function.
PG  - 519
LID - 10.21037/atm.2016.11.81 [doi]
AB  - A population of stem-like cells in tumors, the so-called cancer stem cells
      (CSCs), are being held responsible for therapy resistance and tumor recurrence.
      In analogy with normal stem cells, CSCs possess the capacity of long term
      self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. CSCs are believed to be more
      resistant to various therapies compared to their differentiated offspring and
      therefore the cause of tumor relapse. Markers for CSCs have been identified using
      xenograft transplantation assays and lineage tracing in mouse models, however the
      specificity and validity of many of these markers is under debate. Recently, low 
      proteasome activity has been postulated as a novel CSC marker. In several solid
      malignancies a small subset of low proteasomal activity cells with CSC
      characteristics were identified, suggesting that proteasomal activity might be a 
      functional marker for CSCs. In this perspective, we will discuss a recent study
      by Munakata et al., describing a population of colorectal cancer cells with CSC
      properties, characterized by low proteasome activity and treatment resistance. We
      will put this finding in a broader view by discussing the challenges and issues
      inherent with CSC identification, as well as some emerging insights in the CSC
      concept.

TI  - Taxonomic status of Ligophorus mugilinus (Hargis, 1955) (Monogenea:
      Ancyrocephalidae), with a description of a new species of Ligophorus from Mugil
      cephalus (Teleostei: Mugilidae) in the Mediterranean Basin.
PG  - 1444-51
AB  - Ligophorus mugilinus was originally described on the flathead mullet Mugil
      cephalus from the Gulf of Mexico. The species was later recorded in the
      Mediterranean Sea on the flathead mullet and in the Caribbean Sea on the white
      mullet Mugil curema. After examination of the type material and additional
      specimens of Ligophorus from the northwest Atlantic coast, the Caribbean Sea, and
      the Mediterranean and Black Sea, we observed morphological differences concerning
      haptoral and male copulatory structures between L. mugilinus from the northwest
      Atlantic and the forms from the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Accordingly, the
      latter specimens are described as a new species, Ligophorus mediterraneus n. sp. 
      A redescription of L. mugilinus, including new morphometric data, is also given. 
      The morphometric analysis of the Caribbean specimens suggested that their
      ascription to L. mugilinus is uncertain, but additional material is needed to
      clarify their specific identity. The results of this study, together with
      previous zoogeographical evidence, indicate that flathead mullets from different 
      seas harbor different species complexes of Ligophorus. Given the coastal habits
      of the host, it is suggested that open oceans could act as geographical barriers 
      favoring speciation within disjointed flathead mullet populations.

TI  - Antipsychotic treatment beyond antipsychotics: metacognitive intervention for
      schizophrenia patients improves delusional symptoms.
PG  - 1823-32
LID - 10.1017/S0033291710002618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although antipsychotic medication still represents the treatment of
      choice for schizophrenia, its objective impact on symptoms is only in the
      medium-effect size range and at least 50% of patients discontinue medication in
      the course of treatment. Hence, clinical researchers are intensively looking for 
      complementary therapeutic options. Metacognitive training for schizophrenia
      patients (MCT) is a group intervention that seeks to sharpen the awareness of
      schizophrenia patients on cognitive biases (e.g. jumping to conclusions) that
      seem to underlie delusion formation and maintenance. The present trial combined
      group MCT with an individualized cognitive-behavioural therapy-oriented approach 
      entitled individualized metacognitive therapy for psychosis (MCT+) and compared
      it against an active control. METHOD: A total of 48 patients fulfilling criteria 
      of schizophrenia were randomly allocated to either MCT+ or cognitive remediation 
      (clinical trial NCT01029067). Blind to intervention, both groups were assessed at
      baseline and 4 weeks later. Psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales
      (PSYRATS). Jumping to conclusions was measured using a variant of the beads task.
      RESULTS: PANSS delusion severity declined significantly in the combined MCT
      treatment compared with the control condition. PSYRATS delusion conviction as
      well as jumping to conclusions showed significantly greater improvement in the
      MCT group. In line with prior studies, treatment adherence and subjective
      efficacy was excellent for the MCT. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the
      combination of a cognition-oriented and a symptom-oriented approach ameliorate
      psychotic symptoms and cognitive biases and represents a promising complementary 
      treatment for schizophrenia.

TI  - Endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease - a 30th anniversary update.
PG  - 22-96
LID - 10.1111/apha.12646 [doi]
AB  - The endothelium can evoke relaxations of the underlying vascular smooth muscle,
      by releasing vasodilator substances. The best-characterized endothelium-derived
      relaxing factor (EDRF) is nitric oxide (NO) which activates soluble guanylyl
      cyclase in the vascular smooth muscle cells, with the production of cyclic
      guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) initiating relaxation. The endothelial cells also 
      evoke hyperpolarization of the cell membrane of vascular smooth muscle
      (endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations, EDH-mediated responses). As regards
      the latter, hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) now appears to play a dominant role.
      Endothelium-dependent relaxations involve both pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi (e.g.
      responses to alpha2 -adrenergic agonists, serotonin, and thrombin) and pertussis 
      toxin-insensitive Gq (e.g. adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin) coupling
      proteins. New stimulators (e.g. insulin, adiponectin) of the release of EDRFs
      have emerged. In recent years, evidence has also accumulated, confirming that the
      release of NO by the endothelial cell can chronically be upregulated (e.g. by
      oestrogens, exercise and dietary factors) and downregulated (e.g. oxidative
      stress, smoking, pollution and oxidized low-density lipoproteins) and that it is 
      reduced with ageing and in the course of vascular disease (e.g. diabetes and
      hypertension). Arteries covered with regenerated endothelium (e.g. following
      angioplasty) selectively lose the pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway for NO
      release which favours vasospasm, thrombosis, penetration of macrophages, cellular
      growth and the inflammatory reaction leading to atherosclerosis. In addition to
      the release of NO (and EDH, in particular those due to H2 O2 ), endothelial cells
      also can evoke contraction of the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells by
      releasing endothelium-derived contracting factors. Recent evidence confirms that 
      most endothelium-dependent acute increases in contractile force are due to the
      formation of vasoconstrictor prostanoids (endoperoxides and prostacyclin) which
      activate TP receptors of the vascular smooth muscle cells and that prostacyclin
      plays a key role in such responses. Endothelium-dependent contractions are
      exacerbated when the production of nitric oxide is impaired (e.g. by oxidative
      stress, ageing, spontaneous hypertension and diabetes). They contribute to the
      blunting of endothelium-dependent vasodilatations in aged subjects and essential 
      hypertensive and diabetic patients. In addition, recent data confirm that the
      release of endothelin-1 can contribute to endothelial dysfunction and that the
      peptide appears to be an important contributor to vascular dysfunction. Finally, 
      it has become clear that nitric oxide itself, under certain conditions (e.g.
      hypoxia), can cause biased activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase leading to the 
      production of cyclic inosine monophosphate (cIMP) rather than cGMP and hence
      causes contraction rather than relaxation of the underlying vascular smooth
      muscle.

TI  - An observational study on peripheral blood eosinophilia in incomplete Kawasaki
      disease.
PG  - 160-4
LID - 10.5152/akd.2012.042 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the peripheral blood eosinophilia (PBE) in the acute
      stage of incomplete Kawasaki disease (iKD). METHODS: Twenty-four patients with
      iKD (median age; 31.5 months, range; 7-88 months) and 25 with complete Kawasaki
      disease (cKD) (median age; 37 months, range; 9-140 months) were evaluated between
      2004 and 2010 from Izmir Dr. Behcet Uz Children's Hospital records
      retrospectively. We determined the eosinophil counts and rates from the complete 
      blood count in two study groups before the IVIG treatment and 30 febrile
      age-matched controls and 30 control cases with congenital heart disease (control 
      Group 1 and 2 respectively). Kruskal-Wallis test was performed in detecting the
      differences of eosinophil rates and counts between four subgroups. RESULTS: In
      iKD group, the mean value of eosinophil rates and median value of eosinophil
      counts were 4.39+/-2.5% and 377 cells/mm(3), respectively, which did not
      significantly different with cKD group (mean eosinophil rates; 5.47+/-4.8% and
      median eosinophil counts 525 cells/mm(3)) (p>0.05). The median values of
      eosinophil cell counts and mean value of eosinophil rates were 220 cell/mm(3) and
      2.83+/-2.65% in the control group 1 and 165 cell/mm(3) and 1.63+/-1.43% in the
      control Group 2 respectively, which were statistically significant lower compared
      to both study groups (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: The rate of PBE was found
      significantly higher in iKD patients compared to the controls. Since the
      diagnosis of iKD is difficult, unexplained eosinophilia may be helpful in the
      presence of suggestive clinical findings of KD.

TI  - Prevention of liver ischemia reperfusion injury by a combined thyroid hormone and
      fish oil protocol.
PG  - 1113-20
LID - 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.06.004 [doi]
AB  - Several preconditioning strategies are used to prevent ischemia-reperfusion (IR) 
      liver injury, a deleterious condition associated with tissue resection,
      transplantation or trauma. Although thyroid hormone (T(3)) administration exerts 
      significant protection against liver IR injury in the rat, its clinical
      application is controversial due to possible adverse effects. Considering that
      prevention of liver IR injury has also been achieved by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation to rats, we studied the effect of n-3 PUFA
      dietary supplementation plus a lower dose of T(3) against IR injury. Male
      Sprague-Dawley rats receiving fish oil (300 mg/kg) for 3 days followed by a
      single intraperitoneal dose of 0.05 mg T(3)/kg were subjected to 1 h of ischemia 
      followed by 20 h of reperfusion. Parameters of liver injury (serum transaminases,
      histology) and oxidative stress (liver contents of GSH and oxidized proteins)
      were correlated with fatty acid composition, NF-kappaB activity, and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and haptoglobin expression. IR significantly
      modified liver histology; enhanced serum transaminases, TNF-alpha response or
      liver oxidative stress; and decreased liver NF-kappaB activity and haptoglobin
      expression. Although IR injury was not prevented by either n-3 PUFA
      supplementation or T(3) administration, substantial decrease in liver injury and 
      oxidative stress was achieved by the combined protocol, which also led to
      increased liver n-3 PUFA content and decreased n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios, with recovery
      of NF-kappaB activity and TNF-alpha and haptoglobin expression. Prevention of
      liver IR injury achieved by a combined protocol of T(3) and n-3 PUFA
      supplementation may represent a novel noninvasive preconditioning strategy with
      potential clinical application.

TI  - Propylene glycol is essential in the LCModel basis set for pediatric 1H-MRS.
PG  - 136-9
AB  - Propylene glycol (PG) is an organic solvent used in a variety of parenterally
      injected pharmaceutical preparations. In this current study, we analyzed neonatal
      brains following routine MRS evaluation at 1.5 T, using the LCModel software,
      with and without the addition of PG to the analysis basis-set. We suggest
      including PG in the LCModel basis-set for neonatal brain H-MRS to improve the
      discrimination and quantification of lactate and inositol.

AB  - Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) encodes a small hydrophobic (SH) protein of unknown 
      function. HMPV from which the SH open reading frame was deleted (HMPVDeltaSH) was
      viable and displayed similar replication kinetics, cytopathic effect and plaque
      size compared with wild type HMPV in several cell-lines. In addition, no
      differences were observed in infection efficiency or cell-to-cell spreading in
      human primary bronchial epithelial cells (HPBEC) cultured at an air-liquid
      interphase. Host gene expression was analyzed in A549 cells infected with HMPV or
      HMPVDeltaSH using microarrays and mass spectrometry (MS) based techniques at
      multiple time points post infection. Only minor differences were observed in mRNA
      or protein expression levels. A possible function of HMPV SH as apoptosis
      blocker, as proposed for several members of the family Paramyxoviridae, was
      rejected based on this analysis. So far, a clear phenotype of HMPV SH deletion
      mutants in vitro at the virus and host levels is absent.

PG  - 325-32
AB  - Forty-one categories of patient communications just before therapist
      interventions were identified from a review of psychotherapy transcripts. For
      each communication type, a set of possible therapist interventions was
      constructed. Descriptions of these interactions were sent in the form of a
      questionnaire to 350 experienced clinicians, who were asked to indicate their
      degree of agreement with each possible response. Ratings from the 141 responding 
      clinicians showed little relation to age, gender, experience level, or
      orientation but showed marked differences for different response alternatives. A 
      separate group of seven experienced clinicians used these data to develop a new
      categorization of 15 types of therapist interventions and 5 types of patient
      communications. A tentative information-processing model of patient-therapist
      communications is proposed.

TI  - Effect of condom-use measures in predicting sexually transmitted diseases:
      variation by individual and contextual factors of sexual risk.
PG  - e27-34
LID - 10.1258/ijsa.2009.009071 [doi]
AB  - Inconsistent findings in the global literature regarding the effectiveness of
      condom use against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) may result from
      variations in the measurement of condom use. In this study, we assess the
      sensitivity and specificity of six condom-use measures in predicting STD
      infection, and assess the difference in sensitivity and specificity by type of
      sexual partner (clients versus stable partners), type of STD, ethnicity (Han
      versus non-Han), years of formal schooling (</=6 versus >6 years) and level of
      risk of STD exposure (high versus low). Cross-sectional data were obtained from
      454 female sex workers (FSWs) in Guangxi, China. Measurements of condom use were 
      created along types of use (any use, consistent use, correct use, or the
      combination of consistent and correct use) and periods of recall (life time, last
      month or recent three sexual episodes). Measures of consistent use had higher
      sensitivity and lower specificity than measures of any use in predicting STDs
      among FSWs, regardless of the recall period and type of sexual partner.
      Incorporating correct use improved the measures of consistent use. Measures of
      consistent use and the combination of consistent and correct use demonstrated
      high sensitivity in predicting particular STDs. They showed higher sensitivity in
      predicting STDs among FSWs who reported higher risk for STD exposure than among
      FSWs who reported lower risk of exposure to STDs. In conclusion, the findings
      suggest the superiority of consistent use and correct use of condoms in
      predicting STD infection. The findings also underscore the importance of
      considering the context of sexual risk such as type of sexual partner and risk of
      exposure to STD infection when we measure condom use. Future studies of condom
      effectiveness should collect and quantify these contextual and individual factors
      among the target population.

TI  - Profiling of mitochondrial associated proteins from rat colon.
PG  - 78-97
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction, damage and mutations of mitochondrial proteins give
      rise to a range of ill understood patterns of disease. Although there is
      significant general knowledge of the proteins and the functional processes of the
      mitochondria, there is little knowledge of difference about how mitochondria
      respond and how they are regulated in different organs and tissues. Proteomic
      profiling of mitochondria and associated proteins involved in mitochondrial
      regulation and trafficking within cells and tissues has the potential to provide 
      insights into mitochondrial dysfunction associated with many human diseases. The 
      rat colon mitoproteome analysis presented here provides a useful tool to assist
      in identification and interpretation of mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in
      colon pathogenesis. 2DPAGE followed by LC/MS/MS was used to identify 430 proteins
      from mitochondrial enriched fractions prepared from rat colon, resulting in 195
      different proteins or approximately 50% of the resolved proteins being identified
      as multiple protein expression forms. Proteins associated with the colon
      mitoproteome were involved in calcium binding, cell cycle, energy metabolism and 
      electron transport chain, protein folding, protein synthesis and degradation,
      redox regulation, structural proteins, signalling and transporter and channel
      proteins. The mitochondrial associated proteins identified in this study of colon
      tissue complement and are compared with other recently published mitoproteome
      analyses from other organ tissues, and will assist in revealing potentially organ
      specific roles of the mitochondria and organ specific disease associated with
      mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - Generation and characterization of transgenic mice are important elements of
      biomedical research. In recent years, transgenic technology has become more
      versatile and sophisticated, mainly because of the incorporation of
      recombinase-mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion, site-specific
      endonuclease-mediated genome editing, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, various
      inducible gene expression systems, and fluorescent protein marking and tracking
      techniques. Site-specific recombinases (such as PhiC31) and engineered
      endonucleases (such as ZFN and Talen) have significantly enhanced our ability to 
      target transgenes into specific genomic loci, but currently a great majority of
      transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional
      random insertion method. A major challenge for using this conventional method is 
      that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial influence 
      on the expression of the transgene. Although our understanding of such
      chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive,
      adhering to some general guidelines can significantly increase the odds of
      successful transgene expression. This chapter first discusses the major problems 
      associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles
      for using plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) for generating
      transgenic constructs. Finally, the strategies for conducting each of the major
      types of transgenic research are discussed, including gene overexpression,
      promoter characterization, cell-lineage tracing, mutant complementation,
      expression of double or multiple transgenes, siRNA knockdown, and conditional and
      inducible systems.

AB  - Objective. To investigate the effect by which daily consumption of a novel red
      clover (RC) extract influences bone health, inflammatory status, and
      cardiovascular health in healthy menopausal women. Design. A 12-week randomized, 
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving 60 menopausal women receiving 
      a daily dose of 150 mL RC extract containing 37.1 mg isoflavones (33.8 mg as
      aglycones) or placebo. Methods. Bone parameters were changes in bone mineral
      density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and T-score at the lumbar spine and
      femoral neck. Bone turnover (CTx) and inflammatory markers were measured in
      plasma and finally blood pressure (BP) was evaluated. Results. RC extract had
      positive effect on bone health, and only the women receiving the placebo
      experienced a decline in BMD (p < 0.01) at the lumbar spine. T-score at the
      lumbar spine only decreased in the placebo group (p < 0.01). CTx decreased in the
      RC group with -9.94 (+/-4.93)%, although not significant. Conclusion. Daily
      consumption of RC extract over a 12-week period was found to have a beneficial
      effect on bone health in menopausal women based on BMD and T-score at the lumbar 
      spine and plasma CTx levels. No changes in BP or inflammation markers were found 
      and no side effects were observed.

AB  - Balanced nutrition is fundamental to health and immunity. For herbivorous
      insects, nutrient-compositional shifts in host plants due to elevated atmospheric
      CO2 concentrations and temperature may compromise this balance. Therefore,
      understanding their immune responses to such shifts is vital if we are to predict
      the outcomes of climate change for plant-herbivore-parasitoid and pathogen
      interactions. We tested the immune response of Paropsis atomaria Olivier
      (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) feeding on Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. seedlings
      exposed to elevated CO2 (640 mumol mol(-1); CE) and temperature (ambient plus 4
      degrees C; TE). Larvae were immune-challenged with a nylon monofilament in order 
      to simulate parasitoid or pathogen attack without other effects of actual
      parasitism or pathology. The cellular (in vivo melanisation) and humoral (in
      vitro phenoloxidase PO activity) immune responses were assessed, and linked to
      changes in leaf chemistry. CE reduced foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations and
      increased C:N ratios and concentrations of total phenolics. The humoral response 
      was reduced at CE. PO activity and haemolymph protein concentrations decreased at
      CE, while haemolymph protein concentrations were positively correlated with
      foliar N concentrations. However, the cellular response increased at CE and this 
      was not correlated with any foliar traits. Immune parameters were not impacted by
      TE. Our study revealed that opposite cellular and humoral immune responses
      occurred as a result of plant-mediated effects at CE. In contrast, elevated
      temperatures within the tested range had minimal impact on immune responses.
      These complex interactions may alter the outcomes of parasitoid and pathogen
      attack in future climates.

TI  - Oro-facial pain and temporomandibular disorders classification systems: A
      critical appraisal and future directions.
PG  - 258-268
LID - 10.1111/joor.12590 [doi]
AB  - It is a difficult undertaking to design a classification system for any disease
      entity, let alone for oro-facial pain (OFP) and more specifically for
      temporomandibular disorders (TMD). A further complication of this task is that
      both physical and psychosocial variables must be included. To augment this
      process, a two-step systematic review, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, of the
      classification systems published during the last 20 years for OFP and TMD was
      performed. The first search step identified 190 potential citations which
      ultimately resulted in only 17 articles being included for in-depth analysis and 
      review. The second step resulted in only 5 articles being selected for inclusion 
      in this review. Five additional articles and four classification
      guidelines/criteria were also included due to expansion of the search criteria.
      Thus, in total, 14 documents comprising articles and guidelines/criteria (8
      proposals of classification systems for OFP; 6 for TMD) were selected for
      inclusion in the systematic review. For each, a discussion as to their
      advantages, strengths and limitations was provided. Suggestions regarding the
      future direction for improving the classification process with the use of
      ontological principles rather than taxonomy are discussed. Furthermore, the
      potential for expanding the scope of axes included in existing classification
      systems, to include genetic, epigenetic and neurobiological variables, is
      explored. It is therefore recommended that future classification system proposals
      be based on combined approaches aiming to provide archetypal treatment-oriented
      classifications.

TI  - The effect of irrigation fluid temperature on core body temperature in
      arthroscopic shoulder surgery.
PG  - 531-3
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship
      between irrigation fluid temperature and core body temperature in patients
      undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four
      consecutive patients undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression were
      allocated to receive irrigation fluid at either room temperature (22 degrees C)
      or warmed to 36 degrees C. There were no statistically significant differences
      between the two groups in any of the preoperative parameters. Core temperature
      was monitored throughout surgery. The maximum drop in core temperature for each
      patient was calculated. RESULTS: The mean maximum drop in the room temperature
      group was 1.67 degrees C (95% CI 1.33-1.97) and 0.33 degrees C (95% CI 0.17-0.49)
      in the warmed fluid group (P < 0.001). Further to this the drop in core
      temperature in the room temperature group was maintained throughout surgery
      whereas normothermia resumed by 30 min in the warmed fluid group. CONCLUSION: We 
      thus conclude that core temperature may be influenced by irrigation fluid
      temperature and recommend that fluid be warmed to 36 degrees C.

TI  - Etiology of diarrhea in children younger than 5 years of age admitted in a rural 
      hospital of southern Mozambique.
PG  - 522-7
AB  - Diarrhea is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children in
      sub-Saharan Africa and one of the main causes of hospital admissions in rural
      areas. Stool samples were collected from 529 children admitted with diarrhea to
      the Manhica District Hospital (September 2000 to September 2001) and processed to
      detect bacterial enteropathogens, parasites, and virus. Diarrheagenic Escherichia
      coli, isolated from 120 samples (22.6%; enteroaggregative [corrected] [9.6%],
      enterotoxigenic [6.8%], enteropathogenic [corrected] [4.3%], and verotoxigenic
      [1.9%]) was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Ascaris
      lumbricoides (9.3%). Others detected included Salmonella spp. and Giardia lamblia
      (2.5% each) and Campylobacter spp. (1.7%). A. lumbricoides (92% versus 8%;
      P<0.001) and Strongyloides stercolaris (100% versus 0%; P=0.008) were most
      frequently isolated in children older than 12 months of age. Resistance to
      trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole and ampicillin was high. Etiologic data on
      diarrheal diseases and susceptibility patterns of diarrheal pathogens are
      important tools for clinical management and control strategic planning.

TI  - Meiofaunal prominence and benthic seasonality in a coastal marine ecosystem.
PG  - 157-168
LID - 10.1007/BF00384279 [doi]
AB  - The muds of a shallow (7 m) site in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island contained
      higher abundances of meiofauna (averaging 17x10(6) individuals per m(2) and ash
      free dry weight of 2.9 g/m(2) during a 3 year period) than have been found in any
      other sediment. The majority of sublittoral muds, worldwide, have been reported
      to contain about 10(6) individuals per m(2). This difference is attributed
      primarily to differences in sampling techniques and laboratory
      processing.Extremely high meiofaunal abundances may have also occurred because
      Narragansett Bay sediments were a foodrich environment. While the quantity of
      organic deposition in the bay is not unusually high for coastal waters, this
      input, primarily composed of diatom detritus, may contain an unusually high
      proportion of labile organics. Furthermore, meiofauna could have thrived because 
      of spatial segregation of meiofauna and macrofauna. While meiofauna were
      concentrated at the sediment-water interface, most macrofauna were subsurface
      deposit feeders. Macrofaunal competition with, and ingestion of meiofauna may
      thus have been minimized.The seasonal cycles of meiofauna and macrofauna were
      similar. Highest abundances and biomass were observed in May and June and lowest 
      values in the late summer and fall. Springtime increases of meiofaunal abundance 
      were observed in all depth horizons, to 10 cm. We hypothesize that phytoplankton 
      detritus accumulated in the sediment during the winter and early spring, and that
      the benthos responded to this store of food when temperatures rose rapidly in the
      late spring. By late summer, the stored detritus was exhausted and the benthos
      declined.

      responses in infants.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/2045-7022-4-21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mice models indicate that intact Toll like receptor (TLR) signaling
      may be essential for the allergy protective effects of diverse bacterial exposure
      observed in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Probiotic
      supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri from pregnancy week 36 and to the
      infant through the first year of life decreased the prevalence of IgE-associated 
      eczema at two years (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01285830). The effect of this
      supplementation on innate immune responses to bacterial products and the
      expression of associated TLRs were explored. METHODS: Blood mononuclear cells
      were collected at birth, 6, 12 and 24 months from 61 infants and cultured with
      TLR2, 4 and 9 ligands. Cytokine and chemokine secretion was determined as well as
      TLR2, 4 and 9 mRNA expression. RESULTS: Probiotic supplementation was associated 
      with decreased LTA (lipoteichoic acid) induced CCL4, CXCL8, IL-1beta and IL-6
      responses at 12 months and decreased CCL4 and IL-1beta secretion at 24 months.
      TLR2 mRNA expression was not affected by probiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Decreased responses to TLR2, the main receptor for LTA from Gram positive
      bacteria, in probiotic treated children seem to be dependent on factors
      downstream of TLR mRNA expression.

PG  - 536-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of stent placement and gastrojejunostomy in
      patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Design. Systematic review.
      METHOD: PubMed was searched for relevant articles from January 1996 to January
      2006 and further articles were obtained from their reference lists. Using results
      from these publications, average study scores for improvement of oral intake,
      complications, survival and costs were calculated. Results from randomized and
      comparative studies were pooled and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for
      improvement oforal intake and complications were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 
      44 publications were identified, including 2 randomized trials and 6 comparative 
      studies. Information on study outcomes was not available in all publications.
      Long-term effectiveness was higher after gastrojejunostomy than after stent
      placement, with only 1% of patients needing a reintervention after
      gastrojejunostomy; more patients developed minor complications after
      gastrojejunostomy (33%) and the post-operative hospital stay was on average 13
      days longer. After stent placement obstructive symptoms were relieved in 89% of
      patients and this effect was observed to occur more quickly after placement
      (within 0-2 days). More patients (approximately 20%) required a reintervention
      after stent placement due to stent migration or obstruction. CONCLUSION: Stent
      placement appeared to have favourable short-term results and gastrojejunostomy
      was associated with better long-term results. Well-performed clinical trials with
      an adequate number of patients were not found, which precluded more solid
      conclusions.

TI  - Atheroregressive Potential of the Treatment with a Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody
      against Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans on Pre-existing Lesions in Apolipoprotein
      E-Deficient Mice.
PG  - 782
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2017.00782 [doi]
AB  - The retention of lipoprotein particles in the intima, in particular to
      glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans, is a critical step in
      atherosclerosis initiation. Administration of chP3R99, a chimeric mouse/human
      monoclonal antibody inducing an anti-idiotypic network response against
      glycosaminoglycans was previously shown to prevent atherosclerotic lesion
      progression, yet its effect in the late-stage progression of lesions remains
      unknown. This study investigated the effect of chP3R99 at a late stage of disease
      development in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and the vascular mechanisms
      involved. Male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were fed a high-fat
      high-cholesterol diet from 4 to 19 weeks old, at which time mice were fed normal 
      chow and 5 doses of chP3R99 (50 mug) or isotype-matched IgG (hR3) were
      administered subcutaneously weekly for the first 3 administrations, then at weeks
      24 and 26 before sacrifice (week 28). Lesions progression was reduced by 88% in
      treated mice with no change in total plasma cholesterol levels, yet with
      increased sera reactivity to chP3R99 idiotype and heparin, suggesting the
      induction of an anti-idiotype antibody cascade against glycosaminoglycans, which 
      was likely related with the atheroprotective effect. chP3R99 treatment initiated 
      regression in a significant number of mice. Circulating levels of interleukin-6
      were reduced along with a striking diminution of inflammatory cell accumulation
      in the vessel wall, and of VCAM-1 labeling in vivo. The ratio of IL-10/iNOS gene 
      expression in aortas increased in chP3R99-treated mice. In conclusion, our
      results show that treatment with chP3R99 reduces vascular inflammatory burden and
      halts lesion progression with potential for regression in the late phase of the
      disease in atherosclerotic mice, and support the therapeutic intervention against
      glycosaminoglycans as a novel strategy to reverse atherosclerosis.

TI  - Motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in saturated granular media as affected by
      chemoattractant.
PG  - 113-20
LID - 10.1016/j.jconhyd.2011.08.001 [doi]
AB  - To examine and quantify the effects of glass beads and chemoattractant on
      bacterial motility in granular media, we examined the motile behavior of P.
      aeruginosa in a saturated granular medium and quantified the effects of glass
      beads and the presence of a chemoattractant. By recording individual cell
      trajectories in microfluidic channels under a high-speed confocal microscope, we 
      directly measured the cell's run direction and corresponding run-length, speed
      and turn angle. Bacterial run speed increased in the presence of chemoattractant 
      in both aqueous and granular media. But it decreased in glass-beads compared to
      in aqueous media due to the restricted pore geometry and interactions between
      bacteria and grain surfaces. Notably, the relatively higher frequency
      distribution at turn angles of 170 degrees decreased dramatically, while the
      smaller peak at 70 degrees increased and became dominant on a bimodal
      distribution, showing more bacteria changed directions at smaller turn angles
      rather than reverse their swimming directions. Additionally, the presence of
      glass beads also decreased the chemotactic velocity and random motility by
      similar proportions due to the restrictive geometry and the interactions between 
      bacteria and glass beads surface. Our study indicates that the swimming
      parameters measured from aqueous media cannot be directly adopted in models for
      predicting bacteria travel in granular media.

TI  - General database for ground water site information.
PG  - 743-8
AB  - In most cases, analysis and modeling of flow and transport dynamics in ground
      water systems require long-term, high-quality, and multisource data sets. This
      paper discusses the structure of a multisite database (the H+ database) developed
      within the scope of the ERO program (French Environmental Research Observatory,
      http://www.ore.fr). The database provides an interface between field
      experimentalists and modelers, which can be used on a daily basis. The database
      structure enables the storage of a large number of data and data types collected 
      from a given site or multiple-site network. The database is well suited to the
      integration, backup, and retrieval of data for flow and transport modeling in
      heterogeneous aquifers. It relies on the definition of standards and uses a
      templated structure, such that any type of geolocalized data obtained from wells,
      hydrological stations, and meteorological stations can be handled. New types of
      platforms other than wells, hydrological stations, and meteorological stations,
      and new types of experiments and/or parameters could easily be added without
      modifying the database structure. Thus, we propose that the database structure
      could be used as a template for designing databases for complex sites. An example
      application is the H+ database, which gathers data collected from a network of
      hydrogeological sites associated with the French Environmental Research
      Observatory.

TI  - Biphenyl bicelle disks align perpendicular to magnetic fields on large
      temperature scales: a study combining synthesis, solid-state NMR, TEM, and SAXS.
PG  - 3949-59
AB  - A phosphatidylcholine lipid (PC) containing a biphenyl group in one of its acyl
      chains (1-tetradecanoyl-2-(4-(4-biphenyl)butanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-PC, TBBPC) was
      successfully synthesized with high yield. Water mixtures of TBBPC with a
      short-chain C(6) lipid, dicaproyl-PC (DCPC), lead to bicelle systems formation.
      Freeze-fracture electron microscopy evidenced the presence of flat bilayered
      disks of 800 A diameter for adequate composition, hydration, and temperature
      conditions. Because of the presence of the biphenyl group, which confers to the
      molecule a positive magnetic anisotropy Delta chi, the disks align with their
      normal, n, parallel to the magnetic field B(0), as directly detected by (31)P,
      (14)N, (2)H solid-state NMR and also using small-angle x-ray scattering after
      annealing in the field. Temperature-composition and temperature-hydration
      diagrams were established. Domains where disks of TBBPC/DCPC align with their
      normal parallel to the field were compared to chain-saturated lipid bicelles made
      of DMPC(dimyristoylPC)/DCPC, which orient with their normal perpendicular to
      B(0). TBBPC/DCPC bicelles exist on a narrow range of long- versus short-chain
      lipid ratios (3%) but over a large temperature span around room temperature
      (10-75 degrees C), whereas DMPC/DCPC bicelles exhibit the reverse situation,
      i.e., large compositional range (22%) and narrow temperature span (25-45 degrees 
      C). The two types of bicelles present orienting properties up to 95% dilution but
      with the peculiarity that water trapped in biphenyl bicelles exhibits ordering
      properties twice as large as those observed in the saturated-chains analog, which
      offers very interesting properties for structural studies on hydrophilic or
      hydrophobic embedded biomolecules.

      divided into Control, PAN and BMSC groups. Mice were injected with PAN (0.5 mg/g 
      weight) via the tail vein. The 24-h urinary protein was obtained after modelling,
      and urinary protein excretion was determined. The blood and kidney specimens were
      isolated after the tenth day of modelling. Blood samples were collected for
      measuring serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A sample of
      kidney was taken for observing pathological changes through hematoxylin-eosin
      staining and electron microscopy, and the rest of the kidney was used for
      detecting the protein and mRNA expression of nephrin, CD2AP, synaptopodin, TRPC6 
      by real-time quantitative PCR, Western-blot and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:
      After PAN injection, podocyte foot process fusion was detected by electron
      microscopy, and the 24 h urinary protein excretion increased compared with
      control mice on days 3, 7 and 10 post-PAN injection (P.

PG  - 944-56
AB  - Data on energetic profile of many species Passeriformes and Non-Passeriformes
      show that the basal metabolic rate (BMR) is strongly correlated with potential
      energy (MPE) and potential productive energy (PPE) (MPE is about 4BMR in all
      homeothermic animals). BMR is the minimal power of animal and strongly correlated
      with the daily work output, which may be determined by measuring total animal
      activity. Hence, BMR is the fundamental scale of power which determines the
      intensity of the actual interaction of an individual with the environment. The
      increase in BMR of a particular animal should rise the potential energy (MPE),
      potential productive energy (PPE), and the level of daily work output. BMR in
      Passerines birds is 1.3-1.5 fold higher than that in Non-Passerines and Mammals. 
      Origin ofendothermy in the course of evolution should be associated with needs of
      general activity rather than with the requirements of thermoregulation.

TI  - Mitochondrial injury: a hot spot for parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease?
PG  - pe42
AB  - The recent identification of genes (parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1) involved in
      recessive autosomal parkinsonism, and the indications that these proteins may
      have protective effects on the mitochondria, has led to the reemergence of the
      notion that mitochondrial dysfunction might play a central role in the etiology
      of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). This idea has previously been supported by 
      biochemical analyses showing reduced mitochondrial activity in PD patients and in
      animal models of PD generated by the selective inhibition of mitochondria
      activity. However, the involvement of DJ-1 or PINK1 loss of function in classical
      idiopathic PD, characterized by pathological inclusions composed of aggregated
      alpha-synuclein protein, has still not been evaluated. More detailed studies of
      the possible interactions between parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and alpha-synuclein and
      their effects on mitochondria are needed to more adequately define the biological
      pathways that may convergently or independently lead to parkinsonism.

TI  - Personal information protection - exceptional challenges of integrated systems of
      eHealth.
PG  - 74-9
AB  - Informatization has been bringing important, quick and extensive changes into the
      healthcare environment for years. Individual systems still represent isolated
      information islands; however, the need for interconnectivity and mutual
      accessibility has become more pronounced. On the one hand, integration of systems
      brings numerous, financially measurable advantages, and on the other hand,
      personal information in such systems becomes more vulnerable. Providing personal 
      information protection is therefore the permanent task of informatisation and,
      with elimination of national borders and integration of national systems, it is
      becoming a challenge from the legal, organisational, technical and financial
      standpoints.

TI  - VACTERL anomalies in patients with esophageal atresia: an updated delineation of 
      the spectrum and review of the literature.
PG  - 309-13
AB  - The VACTERL complex refers to anomalies of the bony spinal column (V), atresias
      in the gastrointestinal tract (A), congenital heart lesions (C),
      tracheoesophageal defects (TE), renal and distal urinary tract anomalies (R) and 
      limb lesions (L). The incidence of each of these components has not been
      precisely quantified in the recent literature and the full array of anomalies
      within each systemic class of the VACTERL complex has not been well described.
      Therefore, we reviewed our most recent 20-year experience of patients born with
      esophageal atresia to comprehensively delineate and accurately describe the type 
      and incidence of associated lesions. A retrospective review was then conducted on
      all patients diagnosed with esophageal atresia between 1985 and 2005. Patient
      demographics recorded included gestational age, weight and gender. The specific
      types of lesions were carefully cataloged. The outcome measure recorded was
      survival. One hundred and twelve patients were diagnosed with esophageal atresia 
      were identified during the study period. The gestational age range was 28-41
      weeks with an average of 36.5 weeks. Average birth weight was 2,557 g (range
      1,107-3,890). A male predominance was seen with 62 males and 50 females. The
      overall survival was 92.9%. The categorical breakdown of anomalies were vertebral
      (24.1%), atresia (14.3%), cardiac (32.1%), tracheoesophageal fistula (95.5%),
      urinary (17.0%), skeletal (16.1%) and other (10.8%). VACTERL anomalies are common
      in patients with esophageal atresia, however, they appear to have little impact
      on overall survival.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proximal embolic protection devices (P-EPD) and distal filters (DF)
      are used to prevent distal cerebral embolizations during carotid artery stenting 
      (CAS). We compared their comparative effectiveness in regards to prevention of
      intraprocedural and periprocedural adverse events, including ischemic lesions
      (ipsilateral and contralateral), stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and
      death. We also compared the combination of the two neuroprotection strategies vs.
      a single strategy in regards to ischemic lesions and stroke. MATERIALS & METHODS:
      This study was performed according to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and
      eligible studies were identified through search of PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane
      Central. A meta-analysis was conducted with the use of a random effects model.
      The I-square statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-nine
      studies involving 16,307 patients were included. There was a significant
      reduction in ischemic lesions with the use of P-EPD among observational studies
      (RR: 0.66 [0.45-0.97]). There were no statistically significant differences for
      the other outcomes between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is a
      number of studies reporting outcomes on the comparison between P-EPD and DF for
      CAS. P-EDP can reduce distal embolization phenomena resulting into ischemic
      lesions when compared to DF based on the results from real-world studies. P-EPD
      was not superior however, in regards to periprocedural stroke, TIA and death.
      Further studies are anticipated to provide a clear answer to this debate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical effect of gemcitabine and concurrent
      three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for locally advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: From April 2002 to June 2003, 28
      patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC were treated with gemcitabine and 3D-CRT
      simultaneously. Chemotherapy consisted of intravenously gemcitabine 350 mg/m 2 on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36. 3D-CRT was delivered up to a total dose of 60-64 Gy
      with a 2.0 Gy dose fraction per day, 5 days per week. RESULTS: The overall
      response rates of primary tumor and mediastinum metastatic node were 89.3%(25/28)
      and 96.0%(24/25) respectively, and 94.7%(18/19) and 77.8%(7/9) for squamous cell 
      carcinoma and adenocarcinoma respectively. The acute side effects of patients
      were mostly myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, radiation-induced esophagitis and
      pneumonitis (RTOGI/II), however, all of them were cured. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent 
      application of gemcitabine and 3D-CRT can improve the overall response rate for
      locally advanced NSCLC without aggravating the side effects.

TI  - A novel contrast removal system from the coronary sinus using an adsorbing column
      during coronary angiography in a porcine model.
PG  - 1866-70
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the efficacy of a novel system to remove contrast
      from the coronary sinus (CS) using an adsorbing column during coronary
      angiography. BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has become a serious 
      problem for patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: Eight swine were studied to
      evaluate the efficacy of the contrast removal system. A newly developed 8-F blood
      suction catheter was inserted into the CS via the right femoral vein. The venous 
      blood from the CS was transferred into the 500-ml contrast-adsorbing column using
      an extracorporeal system. A total of 155 ml of contrast medium was infused
      selectively into the coronary artery. Five swine were treated extracorporeally
      for 90 min using adsorbing columns, and three were treated without columns as a
      control group. RESULTS: The mean calculated iodine removal rate was 49.4%. The
      area under the curve of the iodine concentration in the group treated with the
      column was significantly smaller, by 60%, than that of the group treated without 
      the column (p = 0.0003). No significant adverse effects were observed in the
      subjects' vital signs throughout the experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The contrast
      removal system from CS is effective and safe during coronary angiography in
      swine. This technique may be useful for preventing CIN in patients with renal
      insufficiency undergoing PCI.

TI  - Restricted water diffusibility as measured by diffusion-weighted MR imaging and
      choline uptake in (11)C-choline PET/CT are correlated in pelvic lymph nodes in
      patients with prostate cancer.
PG  - 352-61
LID - 10.1007/s11307-010-0337-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: (11)C-Choline-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
      (CT) is increasingly used in patients with prostate cancer. Another promising
      technique for assessment of tumor biology is diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI).
      The aim of the study was to compare the functional parameters standardized uptake
      value (SUV) in PET and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in DWI of lymph
      nodes in prostate cancer patients. PROCEDURES: Fourteen patients with prostate
      cancer underwent DWI at 1.5T and (11)C-Choline-PET/CT. ADC values and SUVs of all
      lymph nodes larger than 5 mm (n = 55) were compared by using linear regression
      analysis. Performance of DWI and (11)C-Choline PET was assessed by receiver
      operator characteristic curve analysis using histopathology or clinical follow-up
      as standard of reference. RESULTS: ADC values and SUV showed a moderate but
      highly significant inverse correlation (r = -0.5144, p < 0.0001). In lymph nodes 
      with low ADC values, the dispersion of SUV was more pronounced. Moreover, a
      highly significant difference was observed for mean ADC values and SUV in lymph
      nodes considered as benign or malignant by follow-up/histopathology (ADC 1.60 +/-
      0.24 vs. 1.09 +/- 0.23 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; SUV 1.82 +/- 0.57 vs. 4.68 +/- 03.12; p 
      < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: These pilot data propose the ADC value in
      DWI as a new potential imaging biomarker which might provide additional
      information on tumor pathophysiology compared to the SUV in (11)C-Choline PET/CT.

AB  - Diseases of the lung are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in the
      elderly. The risk of respiratory infections is increased due to structural
      changes, malnutrition, co-morbidity, and a variety of other factors. Bacterial
      and viral pathogens cause acute bronchitis and exacerbations of chronic
      bronchitis (AECB). Community acquired pneumonias (CAP) show a different spectrum 
      of pathogens and clinical course in comparison to nosocomial pneumonias (hospital
      acquired pneumonia, HAP). Institutionalised patients are at risk of a health care
      associated pneumonia (HCAP), with often a different spectrum of pathogens in
      comparison to CAP and HAP. Elderly patients with cerebrovascular disease and
      impairment of swallowing or cough reflexes often suffer from aspiration
      pneumonias. The mortality is highest in the elderly, comorbid, and
      immunocompromised patient with nosocomial pneumonia. Important preventive
      measures include influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, avoidance of immobility,
      oral hygiene, and sufficient nutrition.

TI  - FDG and Amyloid PET in Cognitively Normal Individuals at Risk for Late-Onset
      Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 15-26
AB  - Having a parent affected by late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major risk
      factor for cognitively normal (NL) individuals. This study explores the potential
      of PET with (18)F-FDG and the amyloid- beta (Abeta) tracer (11)C-Pittsburgh
      Compound B (PiB) for detection of individual risk in NL adults with AD-parents.
      METHODS: FDG- and PiB-PET was performed in 119 young to late-middle aged NL
      individuals including 80 NL with positive family history of AD (FH+) and 39 NL
      with negative family history of any dementia (FH-). The FH+ group included 50
      subjects with maternal (FHm) and 30 with paternal family history (FHp).
      Individual FDG and PiB scans were Z scored on a voxel-wise basis relative to
      modality-specific reference databases using automated procedures and rated as
      positive or negative (+/-) for AD-typical abnormalities using predefined
      criteria. To determine the effect of age, the cohort was separated into younger
      (49 +/- 9 y) and older (68 +/- 5 y) groups relative to the median age (60 y).
      RESULTS: Among individuals of age >60 y, as compared to controls, NL FH+ showed a
      higher frequency of FDG+ scans vs. FH- (53% vs. 6% p < 0.003), and a trend for
      PiB+ scans (27% vs. 11%; p = 0.19). This effect was observed for both FHm and FHp
      groups. Among individuals of age </=60 y, NL FHm showed a higher frequency of
      FDG+ scans (29%) compared to FH- (5%, p = 0.04) and a trend compared to FHp (11%)
      (p = 0.07), while the distribution of PiB+ scans was not different between
      groups. In both age cohorts, FDG+ scans were more frequent than PiB+ scans among 
      NL FH+, especially FHm (p < 0.03). FDG-PET was a significant predictor of FH+
      status. Classification according to PiB status was significantly less successful.
      CONCLUSIONS: Automated analysis of FDG- and PiB-PET demonstrates higher rates of 
      abnormalities in at-risk FH+ vs FH- subjects, indicating potentially ongoing
      early AD-pathology in this population. The frequency of metabolic abnormalities
      was higher than that of Abeta pathology in the younger cohort, suggesting that
      neuronal dysfunction may precede major aggregated Abeta burden in young NL FH+.
      Longitudinal follow-up is required to determine if the observed abnormalities
      predict future AD.

TI  - Assessment of toxic, genotoxic, antigenotoxic, and recombinogenic activities of
      Hymenaea courbaril (Fabaceae) in Drosophila melanogaster and mice.
PG  - 2712-24
LID - 10.4238/2013.July.30.9 [doi]
AB  - Hymenaea courbaril L., popularly known as jatoba, is a plant species that grows
      in the forests of South America. The species has been used for culinary purposes 
      and in folk medicine to treat arthritis and inflammations. Due to the increasing 
      use of this plant globally, the present study aimed to evaluate the toxic,
      genotoxic, recombinogenic, and antigenotoxic effects of H. courbaril sap (Hycs)
      using the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and the somatic mutation and
      recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. To evaluate the aneugenic 
      and clastogenic activities revealed by the micronucleus test, the animals were
      treated with 3 doses of Hycs (5, 10, and 15 mL/kg body weight). To evaluate the
      antianeugenic and anticlastogenic activities, the animals were simultaneously
      treated with Hycs and mitomycin C (4 mg/kg body weight). To assess the mutagenic 
      and recombinogenic activities using SMART, 3-day-old larvae derived from standard
      and high bioactivation crosses were treated with 3 doses of Hycs (3.0, 1.5, and
      0.3 mL) for approximately 48 h. To evaluate antimutagenic and antirecombinogenic 
      activities, larvae derived from both crosses were co-treated with 3 doses of Hycs
      (3.0, 1.5, and 0.3 mL) and doxorubicin (0.125 mg/ mL). The mouse bone marrow
      micronucleus test revealed that Hycs exhibited no cytotoxic, clastogenic and/or
      aneugenic effects, but did show anticytotoxic, anticlastogenic and/or
      antianeugenic activities. The SMART revealed no mutagenic or recombinogenic
      effects, but antimutagenic and antirecombinogenic activities were observed in
      somatic cells of D. melanogaster from both crosses.

TI  - The neural substrates of affective processing toward positive and negative
      affective pictures in patients with major depressive disorder.
PG  - 1487-92
AB  - Previous studies examining neural responses to emotional stimuli in individuals
      with major depressive disorder (MDD) have indicated increased responses within
      the left amygdala to sad faces, and increased activity within the visual cortex
      and striatum to expressions of happiness. Using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI), the current study measured neural responses to neutral, positive 
      and negative pictures of the International Affective Picture System in 15 healthy
      individuals and 15 patients with MDD. Depressed individuals demonstrated lower
      activity in the right hippocampus and the right insula to negative affective
      pictures, whereas they showed lower activity in the right anterior cingulate
      cortex and the left insula to positive pictures. However, within the MDD group,
      the severity of depression correlated with the activity of the left amygdala,
      bilateral inferior orbitofrontal areas, and the left insula to negative pictures,
      whereas there were no clear indications of association between specific cerebral 
      regions and positive pictures. Our findings indicate that preferential decreases 
      in the left amygdala in response to negative pictures might be involved in the
      processing of emotional stimuli in depressed individuals. Also, these findings
      suggest that the bilateral inferior orbitofrontal cortices and left amygdala may 
      be preferentially recruited in MDD patients, but not in healthy individuals.

AB  - Hearing perception in individuals with auditory hallucinations has not been well 
      studied. Auditory hallucinations have previously been shown to involve primary
      auditory cortex activation. This activation suggests that auditory hallucinations
      activate the terminal of the auditory pathway as if auditory signals are
      submitted from the cochlea, and that a hallucinatory event is therefore perceived
      as hearing. The primary auditory cortex is stimulated by some unknown source that
      is outside of the auditory pathway. The current study aimed to assess the
      outcomes of stimulating the primary auditory cortex through the auditory pathway 
      in individuals who have experienced auditory hallucinations. Sixteen patients
      with schizophrenia underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      sessions, as well as hallucination assessments. During the fMRI session, auditory
      stimuli were presented in one-second intervals at times when scanner noise was
      absent. Participants listened to auditory stimuli of sine waves (SW) (4-5.5kHz), 
      English words (EW), and acoustically reversed English words (arEW) in a block
      design fashion. The arEW were employed to deliver the sound of a human voice with
      minimal linguistic components. Patients' auditory hallucination severity was
      assessed by the auditory hallucination item of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
      (BPRS). During perception of arEW when compared with perception of SW, bilateral 
      activation of the globus pallidus correlated with severity of auditory
      hallucinations. EW when compared with arEW did not correlate with auditory
      hallucination severity. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of the globus
      pallidus to the human voice is associated with the severity of auditory
      hallucination.

AB  - The RegIV gene is differentially expressed in cancer and noncancerous cells. In
      this study, we investigated the role of RegIV and its CRD domain in the invasion 
      and migration of human colorectal carcinoma LoVo cells. Recombinant plasmids,
      pcDNA3.1-RegIV and pcDNA3.1-RegIV CRD, were constructed and transfected into LoVo
      cells. The in vivo RegIV and RegIV CRD mRNA and protein levels were then analyzed
      by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry,
      respectively. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT
      (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and flat plate
      colony-forming assays, and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Cell
      migration and invasion were assessed with a Transwell chamber. A high level of
      RegIV and RegIV carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) expression was demonstrated
      in RegIV and RegIV CRD-transfected cells. There were no differences in cell
      proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis between the LoVo/RegIV and
      untreated LoVo cells (P > 0.05). However, the LoVo/RegIV cells, but not
      LoVo/RegIV CRD cells, displayed greater migration and invasion abilities compared
      to the empty vector and untreated LoVo cells. The migrated cell numbers of the
      LoVo/RegIV, LoVo/RegIV CRD, LoVo/empty vector, and control LoVo groups were
      247.00 +/- 10.61, 146.27 +/- 6.81, 151.16 +/- 7.18, and 149.65 +/- 6.53 cells per
      field, respectively (P < 0.05). The invasion cell numbers of the four groups were
      57.00 +/- 3.00, 31.53 +/- 2.72, 30.3 +/- 2.07, and 32.16 +/- 2.30 cells per
      field, respectively. RegIV enhances LoVo cell migration and invasion, and its CRD
      domain is critical for these effects.

TI  - Association between red cell distribution width and P-wave dispersion in patients
      with atrial tachyarrhythmia.
PG  - 8141-6
AB  - Although red cell distribution width (RDW) and P-wave dispersion (Pwd) are strong
      independent predictors of atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATa), the association between
      these two factors in the occurrence of ATA has hitherto not been reported. We
      retrospectively analyzed the cases of ATa patients who underwent Holter
      monitoring at our hospital from October 2013 to August 2014. Clinical data
      including RDW and color doppler ultrasonography data were collected, and Pwd was 
      calculated from synchronous recording of P-wave intervals of 12-lead
      electrocardiograms. Patients were categorized into three groups in ascending
      order of RDW values. Between-group comparisons yielded significant differences in
      Pwd, left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDD), and left atrial diameter (LAD; P
      < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the RDW level positively
      correlated with the Kleiger grade of atrial arrhythmia (r = 0.280, P < 0.001),
      Pwd (r = 0.148, P = 0.001), and LAD (r = 0.297, P < 0.001); Pwd positively
      correlated with the Kleiger grade of atrial arrhythmia (r = 0.257, P < 0.001),
      aortic root diameter (r = 0.143, P < 0.002), and LAD (r = 0.201, P < 0.001).
      Binary logistic multiple regression analysis with ATa as the dependent variable
      revealed that Pwd [odds ratio (OR) = 1.024], RDW [OR = 1.215], and aortic root
      diameter [OR = 1.030] were significant risk factors for ATa occurrence. This is
      the first study to establish a correlation between RDW and Pwd in the occurrence 
      of ATa; however, further prospective studies using large cohorts are required to 
      validate the correlation.

PG  - 2375-82
LID - 10.1002/ijc.24664 [doi]
AB  - Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T-cell
      leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). It has been postulated that ATLL cells might act as
      regulatory T cells (T(regs)) which, in common with ATLL cells, express both CD25 
      and FoxP3, and so contribute to the severe immune suppression typical of ATLL. We
      report here that the frequency of CD25(+) cells varied independently of the
      frequency of FoxP3(+) cells in both a cross-sectional study and in a longitudinal
      study of 2 patients with chronic ATLL. Furthermore, the capacity of ATLL cells to
      suppress proliferation of heterologous CD4(+)CD25(-) cells correlated with the
      frequency of CD4(+) FoxP3(+) cells but was independent of CD25 expression.
      Finally, the frequency of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) cells was inversely correlated with the 
      lytic activity of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in patients with ATLL. We conclude that
      ATLL is not a tumor of FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells, and that a population of
      FoxP3(+) cells distinct from ATLL cells has regulatory functions and may impair
      the cell-mediated immune response to HTLV-1 in patients with ATLL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant cell death is a normal process during plant development. Mutant
      plants may exhibit misregulation of this process, which can lead to severe growth
      defects. Simple ways of visualising cell death in living plant tissues can aid
      the study of plant development and physiology. RESULTS: Spectral variants of the 
      fluorescent SYTOX dyes were tested for their usefulness for the detection of
      non-viable cells within plant embryos and roots using confocal laser-scanning
      microscopy. The dyes were selective for non-viable cells and showed very little
      background staining in living cells. Simultaneous detection of SYTOX dye and
      fluorescent protein (e.g. GFP) fluorescence was possible. CONCLUSION: The
      fluorescent SYTOX dyes are useful for an easy and quick first assay of plant cell
      viability in living plant samples using fluorescence and confocal laser-scanning 
      microscopy.

LID - 10.3109/14767058.2012.684173 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate what measurements and planes
      are being assessed during second-trimester scan in Brazil, some characteristics
      from performing physicians and whether informed consent is being asked. METHODS: 
      Invitational e-mails were sent for all physicians registered in the database from
      three institutions. Participants who agreed to participate were directed to an
      online survey consisting 21 questions. All participants who agreed to participate
      and sent the online survey were included. We excluded participants who sent an
      incomplete survey; those who perform </= 10 second-trimester scans per month and 
      those who do not work in Brazil. RESULTS: A total of 41,847 invitational e-mails 
      were submitted, and 467 participants were included in the final analysis. We
      observed a relatively low proportion of participants examining some important
      planes from fetal heart: only approximately 80% usually examine the five-chamber 
      and three-vessel views and only 44.3% examine the tracheal view. Regarding the
      expertise of examiners, we observed that 10.7% of participants do not have any
      certificate acknowledged by our official institutions. Additionally, only 7.9% of
      the participants ask for signed informed consent before examination. CONCLUSIONS:
      Specific guidelines are still missing. A relatively high proportion of
      second-trimester scan do not evaluate even what is suggested to be performed in a
      routine second-trimester scan.

TI  - DP-b99, a membrane-activated metal ion chelator, as neuroprotective therapy in
      ischemic stroke.
PG  - 1774-8
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.506378 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DP-b99 is a chelator of zinc and calcium ions that acts
      selectively within cell membranes and has neuroprotective properties in animal
      models of stroke. We present the results of a multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized trial to assess the safety and potential
      protective effects of DP-b99 in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: One hundred and
      fifty stroke patients with signs of cortical involvement and a National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 7 to 20 received a 4-day
      course of intravenous 1 mg/kg per day DP-b99 or placebo within 1 to 9 hours of
      stroke onset. Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was not
      allowed. RESULTS: No major differences in mortality rate, causes of death,
      adverse events, safety laboratory tests, and ECG parameters were found between
      the 2 groups. The baseline NIHSS score of the 72 DP-b99- and 75 placebo-treated
      patients in the intent-to-treat cohort was (mean+/-SD) 12.2+/-4.0 and 12.6+/-3.3,
      respectively; the time to needle (mean+/-SD) was 6:36+/-1:47 and 6:28+/-1:33
      hours, respectively; and the age (mean+/-SD) was 73.3+/-9.9 and 72.0+/-9.6 years,
      respectively. The 90-day median change from baseline (the primary end point) was 
      -6.0 and -5.0 NIHSS points in the DP-b99 and placebo groups, respectively
      (nonsignificant). At 90 days, there was a significantly better outcome in the
      DP-b99 group compared with the placebo group (modified Rankin scale score of 0,
      1, or same as prestroke): 30.6% and 16.0%, respectively (P=0.05). The recovery
      rate was unaffected by the time to needle. Further analyses indicated that the
      90-day median change from baseline in patients with an entry NIHSS score of 10 to
      16 was 8.0 and 5.0 points in the DP-b99 and placebo groups, respectively
      (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this small-scale study, the primary end point of change
      in NIHSS score from baseline to 90 days was not met. However, secondary end
      points demonstrated a significantly improved 90-day recovery rate with treatment 
      with DP-b99 when compared with placebo. In addition, in patients with baseline
      NIHSS scores of 10 to 16, a significant post hoc change in NIHSS score from
      baseline to day 90 was observed. No major safety problems were identified. These 
      findings need to be confirmed with a larger prospective study of strokes
      involving the cortex.

TI  - Role of secreted oxidative stress-induced factors (SOXFs) in the pathogenesis of 
      atherosclerosis.
PG  - 1256-9
AB  - Oxidative stress, a state of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity,
      has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, including
      atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis. Recently we have identified
      several SOXFs (Secreted OXidative stress-induced Factors) from vascular smooth
      muscle cells (VSMC). Our studies have demonstrated that SOXF function as redox
      mediators to regulate growth of VSMC, inflammation and apoptosis of endothelial
      cells, and are involved in the processes of vascular lesion formation after
      vascular injury and in apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. Understanding
      the mechanisms by which ROS stimulate secretion of SOXF and the role of SOXF in
      vascular cells should provide important insight into the cellular response to
      oxidative stress and new therapeutic targets for vascular diseases.

TI  - Relationship between working memory performance and neural activation measured
      using near-infrared spectroscopy.
PG  - 544-51
LID - 10.1002/brb3.238 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory (WM) is a key function for various cognitive
      processes. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerful technique for
      noninvasive functional imaging. However, a study has yet to be published on the
      application of NIRS for evaluating WM performance. The objective was to evaluate 
      NIRS for measuring WM performance. METHODS: Subjects were trained to perform a
      visuospatial WM task. Eight channels on the lateral prefrontal cortex were
      analyzed. We asked the following three questions: (1) Does WM performance
      correlate with NIRS signal amplitudes? (2) What are the differences in NIRS
      amplitudes between correct- and incorrect-WM tasks? (3) Is there a correlation
      between WM performance and NIRS amplitudes in only correct-WM tasks? RESULTS:
      NIRS activation in all channels correlated with WM performance (P < 0.05). There 
      was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in seven channels between
      NIRS amplitude in correct- and incorrect-WM tasks. NIRS activation of the delay
      time averaged with only correct-WM tasks, correlated with WM performance in six
      channels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with better WM performance have higher
      levels of oxyhemoglobin activation compared with control trials in the WM delay
      time, and our results suggest that NIRS will be useful for measuring the WM
      performance.

TI  - Down-regulation of the detoxifying enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 by
      vanadium in Hepa 1c1c7 cells.
PG  - 261-9
AB  - Recent data suggest that vanadium (V5+) compounds exert protective effects
      against chemical-induced carcinogenesis, mainly through modifying various
      xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. In fact, we have shown that V5+ down-regulates
      the expression of Cyp1a1 at the transcriptional level through an ATP-dependent
      mechanism. However, incongruously, there is increasing evidence that V5+ is found
      in higher amounts in cancer cells and tissues than in normal cells or tissues.
      Therefore, the current study aims to address the possible effect of this metal on
      the regulation of expression of an enzyme that helps maintain endogenous
      antioxidants used to protect tissues/cells from mutagens, carcinogens, and
      oxidative stress damage, NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1). In an attempt 
      to examine these effects, Hepa 1c1c7 cells and its AhRdeficient version, c12,
      were treated with increasing concentrations of V5+ in the presence of two
      distinct Nqo1 inducers, the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and
      isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SUL). Our results showed that V5+ inhibits the TCDD-
      and SUL-mediated induction of Nqo1 at mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity
      levels. At transcriptional level, V5+ was able to decrease the TCDD- and
      SUL-induced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and the subsequent binding to
      antioxidant responsive element (ARE) without affecting Nrf2 protein levels.
      Looking at post-transcriptional level; we found that V5+ did not affect Nqo1 mRNA
      transcripts turn-over rates. However, at the post-translational level V5+
      increased Nqo1 protein half-life. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates
      that V5+ down-regulates Nqo1 at the transcriptional level, possibly through
      inhibiting the ATP-dependent activation of Nrf2.

TI  - Purified human chondroitin-4-sulfate reduced MMP/TIMP imbalance induced by iron
      plus ascorbate in human fibroblast cultures.
PG  - 21-30
AB  - Imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of matrix
      metalloproteinases (TIMPs) is an important control point in tissue remodelling.
      Several findings have reported a marked MMP/TIMP imbalance in a variety of in
      vitro models in which oxidative stress was induced. Since previous studies showed
      that commercial hyaluronan and chondroitin-4-sulphate are able to limit lipid
      peroxidation during oxidative stress, we investigated the antioxidant capacity of
      purified human plasma chondroitin-4-sulfate in reducing MMP and TIMP imbalance in
      a model of ROS-induced oxidative injury in fibroblast cultures. Purified human
      plasma chondroitin-4-sulfate was added to the fibroblast cultures exposed to
      FeSO4 plus ascorbate. We assayed cell death, MMP and TIMP mRNA expression and
      protein activities, DNA damage, membrane lipid peroxidation, and aconitase
      depletion. FeSO4 plus ascorbate produced severe death of cells and increased
      MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and protein activities. It also caused DNA
      strand breaks, enhanced lipid peroxidation and decreased aconitase. TIMP-1 and
      TIMP-2 protein levels and mRNA expression remain unaltered. Purified human plasma
      C4S, at three different doses, restored the MMP/TIMP homeostasis, increased cell 
      survival, reduced DNA damage, inhibited lipid peroxidation and limited impairment
      of aconitase. These results further support the hypothesis that these
      biomolecules possess antioxidant activity and by reducing ROS production C4S may 
      limit cell injury produced by MMP/TIMP imbalance.

TI  - Delay Estimation Using Instantaneous Frequency and Phase Difference--Simulation
      Study.
PG  - 394-407
LID - 10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2524690 [doi]
AB  - We propose a time-domain delay estimator that takes the slope of the best fit
      line crossing the origin in the instantaneous frequency-phase difference plane as
      the delay estimate. This formulation differs from existing phase-based estimators
      in two respects. First, we find the instantaneous frequency at all individual
      sample points, including large and abrupt spikes caused by destructive
      interference in the coherent scattering process. This differs from Loupas which
      finds a smoothed-out center frequency estimate within an observation window. We
      show that under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the information from these
      spikes can be properly used. Second, we show that error ought to be considered as
      the deviation of the phase difference from the best fit line rather than
      deviation from the averaged phase difference. Without considering instantaneous
      frequency, phase-based estimators make the following two errors: samples with
      phase difference far away from the center frequency need not be errors as they
      naturally have large phase difference when their instantaneous frequency is
      large; samples with phase difference close to the center frequency may in fact be
      errors if their instantaneous frequency is large. We derive the Gauss-Markov
      least-squares best fit line and then propose an iterative variant that removes
      samples from the line-fitting process if its deviation from the best fit line is 
      sufficiently large. The iterative version can reduce the effect of aliasing for
      larger delays and also further reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the
      estimate. Simulation studies using various bandwidth, SNR, and delay parameters
      indicate that iterative phase least squares (PLS) begins to outperform
      correlation phase Loupas at between SNR of 30 dB (for larger bandwidths and
      larger delays) and 60 dB (for smaller bandwidths and smaller delays). As SNR
      increases, iterative PLS can reach a 30- to 50-dB increase in performance over
      correlation phase Loupas with respect to RMSE in the most favorable conditions.

AB  - A new C-30 steroid, 3beta-,5alpha-,6beta-,11alpha-,20beta-pentahydroxygorgosterol
      (1), and a new diterpenoid, xeniumbellal (2), along with three known
      aromadendrane-type sesquiterpenes, aromadendrene (3), palustrol (4) and
      viridiflorol (5), were isolated from the soft coral Xenia umbellata. Chemical
      structures were determined by analyzing their NMR and MS data. The antimicrobial 
      and antitumor activities of the isolated compounds were examined. Both 1 and 2
      showed moderate antibacterial activities, especially against the
      multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC 0.22 and 0.28 mM, respectively);
      while 2 showed antitumor activity against a lymphoma cell line with LD50 0.57 mM 
      and was nontoxic to Artemia salina at all tested concentrations up to about 4 mM.

TI  - Discovery of ATL: an odyssey in restrospect.
PG  - 423-8
LID - 10.1007/s12185-011-0957-x [doi]
AB  - Forty years have passed since our initial description of peculiar cases of
      adult-onset leukemia with abnormal cells having multi-convoluted nuclei and T
      cell properties, frequent in the southern regions of Japan in the early 1970s.
      Retrospectively, the study of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and the related virus
      HTLV-I was a forerunner for all of human retrovirology, in which AIDS and the
      related retrovirus HIV were identified a few years later in the 1980s. Using the 
      anti-TAC monoclonal antibody generated by the late Takashi Uchiyama during his
      stay in T. A. Waldmann's laboratory in NIH Bethesda, a cDNA encoding IL-2Ralpha
      chain was cloned by our group in Kyoto and by Waldmann's group in Bethesda.
      Abnormal IL-2Ralpha chain expression and the IL-2 dependency of ATL cell lines
      greatly contributed to the study of leukemogenesis of ATL. A new soluble factor
      named ADF/ATL-derived factor was also detected in ATL cell lines. After years of 
      study, ADF proved to be a first human counterpart of thiol-related
      oxido-reductase thioredoxin/TRX, which opened the field of redox regulation of
      cell signaling involved in a variety of diseases. Close interaction among Drs.
      Kimishige Ishizaka, Kiyoshi Takastuki and T. A. Waldmanns before ATL and HTLV-I
      study was an essential base for our initiation of ATL research with Takashi
      Uchiyama and many other colleagues.

TI  - Muscular dystrophies: histology, immunohistochemistry, molecular genetics and
      management.
PG  - 978-87
AB  - Muscle degeneration and regeneration are two of the most evident pathological
      events characterizing muscular diseases and in particular muscular dystrophies.
      Muscular dystrophies are an heterogeneous group of hereditary diseases affecting 
      both children and adults, and are characterized by muscle wasting and weakness.
      Until now at least 30 different genes have been associated with muscular
      dystrophies. They have been divided into several subgroups depending on the
      distribution of the muscle weakness. Thus, the histopathological markers of all
      these forms are dystrophic changes at the muscle biopsy characterized by fiber
      size variability, fibres necrosis, regeneration, inflammation and connective
      tissues deposition. As for now, no effective therapy is available for these
      diseases but new inside has now been expanded in regenerative therapy such as
      cell therapy and gene therapy. This review is focused on muscular dystrophies and
      new acknowledgments in regenerative therapy.

TI  - Regulatory activity of human CD4 CD25 T cells depends on allergen concentration, 
      type of allergen and atopy status of the donor.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - Regulatory CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3-positive T cells (Treg) are functional in most atopic
      patients with allergic rhinitis and are able to inhibit T helper type 1 (Th1) and
      Th2 cytokine production of CD4+ CD25- T cells. This study was designed to analyse
      the following additional aspects: influence of allergen concentration, influence 
      of the type of allergen, and influence of the atopy status of the donor on the
      strength of the regulatory activity. CD4+ CD25- T cells from healthy non-atopic
      controls or from grass-pollen-allergic or wasp-venom-allergic donors were
      stimulated alone or in the presence of Treg with autologous mature
      monocyte-derived dendritic cells which were pulsed with different concentrations 
      of the respective allergens. Treg from grass-pollen-allergic donors failed to
      inhibit proliferation but not cytokine production of CD4+ CD25- T cells at high
      antigen doses while Treg from non-atopic donors did not fail at these allergen
      concentrations. Proliferative responses and cytokine production of CD4+ CD25- T
      cells from most of the examined wasp-venom-allergic patients were not inhibited
      at any concentration of wasp venom. The use of wasp venom- or phospholipase
      A2-pulsed dendritic cells for stimulation of CD4+ CD25- T cells from donors who
      were not allergic to wasp stings only resulted in an inhibited proliferation and 
      Th2 cytokine production by Treg at 10-fold lower than the optimal concentration, 
      while interferon-gamma production was inhibited at all concentrations
      investigated. These data demonstrate that in allergic diseases the function of
      Treg is dependent on the concentration and the type of the respective allergen
      with different thresholds for individual allergens and patients.

TI  - Cognitive mediation of clinical improvement after intensive exposure therapy of
      agoraphobia and social phobia.
PG  - 294-301
LID - 10.1002/da.20651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study investigated cognitive mediation of clinical
      improvement in patients with agoraphobia (N=427) or social phobia (N=98)
      receiving high-density exposure therapy in a naturalistic clinical treatment
      setting. METHODS: Patients were assessed before therapy, 6 weeks after the end of
      therapy, and 1 year thereafter, using a self-report assessment battery. Lower
      level mediation analyses provided support for the notion that cognitive changes
      partially mediate clinical improvement after exposure therapy. RESULTS: Changes
      in cognitions relating to physical catastrophes mediated treatment outcome only
      for patients with agoraphobia, whereas changes in cognitions about loss of
      control mediated outcome for both agoraphobia and social phobia patients. Changes
      in relationship satisfaction did not mediate symptomatic improvement.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results extend previous findings by demonstrating mediation in

AB  - Traceable truncated Neuropeptide Y (NPY) analogues with Y1 receptor (Y1R)
      affinity and selectivity are highly desirable tools in studying receptor
      location, regulation, and biological functions. A range of fluorescently labeled 
      analogues of a reported Y1R/Y4R preferring ligand BVD-15 have been prepared and
      evaluated using high content imaging techniques. One peptide, [Lys(2)(sCy5),
      Arg(4)]BVD-15, was characterized as an Y1R antagonist with a pKD of 7.2 measured 
      by saturation analysis using fluorescent imaging. The peptide showed 8-fold lower
      affinity for Y4R (pKD = 6.2) and was a partial agonist at this receptor. The
      suitability of [Lys(2)(sCy5), Arg(4)]BVD-15 for Y1R and Y4R competition binding
      experiments was also demonstrated in intact cells. The nature of the label was
      shown to be critical with replacement of sCy5 by the more hydrophobic Cy5.5
      resulting in a switch from Y1R antagonist to Y1R partial agonist.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The evidence linking nursing care and patient outcomes has been
      globally demonstrated. Thus, it is time for translation and application of this
      evidence to robust measurement that uniquely demonstrates the value of nursing
      care and the characteristics of the nursing workforce that contribute to optimal 
      patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and develop
      standardized measures representative of pediatric nursing care of the
      cardiovascular patient for benchmarking within freestanding children's hospitals.
      METHODS: Using a consensus-based approach, the Consortium of Congenital Cardiac
      Care- Measurement of Nursing Practice (C4-MNP) members developed quality measures
      within working groups and then individually critiqued all drafted measures. Final
      draft measures were then independently reviewed and critiqued by an external
      nursing quality measurement committee. The final quality measures were also made 
      available to a national parent support group for feedback. OUTCOMES: The
      development process used by C4-MNP resulted in 10 measures eligible for testing
      across freestanding children's hospitals. Employing a collaborative
      consensus-based method plus implementing the criteria of the National Quality
      Forum and external vetting period provided a strong framework for the development
      and evaluation of standardized measures. NEXT STEPS: The Consortium will continue
      with implementation and testing of each measure in 9 of our 28 collaborating
      centers. This activity will support initial development of benchmarks and
      evaluation of the association of the measures with patient outcomes.

TI  - Clinical anatomy of the mastoid and occipital emissary veins in a large series.
PG  - 139-44
LID - 10.1007/s00276-008-0423-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Detailed descriptions of the mastoid emissary veins (MEVs) and the 
      foramina through which they travel are lacking in the literature. Therefore, the 
      aim of our study was to explore and delineate the morphology, topography and
      morphometry of the MEV, mastoid foramen (MF) and occipital foramen (OF). One
      hundred cadaver heads and 100 dried human skulls were grossly examined RESULTS:
      The MF and OF varied from being absent to having as many as four small openings, 
      each transmitting an emissary vein. The overall prevalence of MEV was 98% on the 
      right and 72% on the left. The overall prevalence of OF was 7% on the right and
      4% on the left. The mean length of the MEV from its point of origin to its point 
      of termination was found to be 7.2 cm with a range of 3.8-11.8 cm. The mean
      diameter of the MEV at the mastoid emissary foramen was 3.5 mm with a range of
      1.1-5.6 mm. In the majority of the cadavers (85%) it was observed that mastoid
      and occipital emissary veins formed a confluent venous system, while in the
      remaining 15%, they remained as single vessels. CONCLUSIONS: The MEV may be a
      significant source of bleeding during surgery of the skull base or middle ear,
      particularly during retrosigmoid and far-lateral approaches and detailed
      anatomical knowledge may help to prevent these complications. Endovascular
      treatment of dural arteriovenous fistulas is often extremely difficult due to
      limited access, however, the use of the MEV represents a unique and potentially
      valuable technique for accessing an isolated or inaccessible transverse or
      sigmoid sinus system.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to determine the occupational risks and
      their effects on the work stress of the health professionals working in state
      hospitals in the Southeast of Turkey. METHODS: This cross-sectional and
      descriptive study was composed of 360 health professionals of the Pazarcik,
      Ergani, and Sehitkamil State Hospitals between December 2014 and January 2015.
      The data of the study were obtained by performing the survey which was composed
      of questions related to the socio-demographic characteristics, factors that were 
      thought to affect the occupational risks and job stress, as well as, the
      questions of the Work Stress Scale. The analyses of the data have been performed 
      using Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: The working
      hours, the number of being on-duty, insomnia, and burnout in health professionals
      were determined to be with the highest mean scores among other stressful risks
      and hazards. The mean work stress level, which increases the success by creating 
      the group-stimulus effect, was indicated as 2.4 and 2.5 for the health
      professionals in Pazarcik and Ergani State Hospital, respectively. However, the
      stress level which poses a threat for the group-health and efficiency was found
      to be 4.0 for the health professionals of the Sehitkamil State Hospital.
      CONCLUSIONS: As the exposure of the occupational risks increases in the health
      professionals, the work stress scores also increase (p < 0.05). The occupational 
      risks and work stress of the health professionals in the Sehitkamil State
      Hospital should be evaluated in terms of occupational health and safety.

AB  - Patients with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia with acute medical 
      problems, who have lost capacity and are without advance directives, are at risk 
      of being over treated inhospitals. To deal with this growing demographic and
      ethical crisis, patients with dementia need to plan for their future medical care
      while they have capacity to do so. This article will examine the role of each
      member of the dementia care triad and how to empower the patient to participate
      in planning future medical care. A case will be made that physicians have the
      same professional disclosure obligations to dementia patients as they do to all
      other capable patients with terminal illnesses. Because there is little consensus
      about what facts should be included in a diagnostic disclosure, this article will
      offer a proposal to empower newly diagnosed patients with dementia with capacity 
      to plan for their future medical care.

TI  - Cytosolic prion protein induces apoptosis in human neuronal cell SH-SY5Y via
      mitochondrial disruption pathway.
PG  - 444-9
AB  - Different neurodegenerative disorders like prion disease, is caused by protein
      misfolding conformers. Reverse-transfected cytosolic prion protein (PrP) and PrP 
      expressed in the cytosol have been shown to be neurotoxic. To investigate the
      possible mechanism of neurotoxicity due to accumulation of PrP in cytosol, a PrP 
      mutant lacking the signal and GPI (CytoPrP) was introduced into the SH-SY5Y cell.
      MTT and trypan blue assays indicated that the viability of cells expressing
      CytoPrP was remarkably reduced after treatment of MG-132. Obvious apoptosis
      phenomena were detected in the cells accumulated with CytoPrP, including loss of 
      mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increase of caspase-3 activity, more
      annexin V/PI-double positive-stained cells and reduced Bcl-2 level. Moreover, DNA
      fragmentation and TUNEL assays also revealed clear evidences of late apoptosis in
      the cells accumulated CytoPrP. These data suggest that the accumulation of
      CytoPrP in cytoplasm may trigger cell apoptosis, in which mitochondrial relative 
      apoptosis pathway seems to play critical role.

TI  - Development and Validation of the Food Liking Questionnaire in a French-Canadian 
      Population.
LID - E1337 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu9121337 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire assessing
      food liking in a French-Canadian population. A questionnaire was developed, in
      which participants were asked to rate their degree of liking of 50 food items. An
      expert panel evaluated the content validity. For the validation study, 150 men
      and women completed the questionnaire twice. An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
      was performed to assess the number of subscales of the questionnaire. Internal
      consistency and test-retest reliability of the subscales were evaluated.
      Concurrent validity was assessed through correlations between liking scores and
      self-reported frequencies of consumption. Comments from the experts led to
      changes in the list of foods included in the questionnaire. The EFA revealed a
      two-factor structure for the questionnaire (i.e., savory and sweet foods) and led
      to the removal of nine items, resulting in a 32-item questionnaire. The two
      subscales revealed good internal consistency (Cronbach alphas: 0.85 and 0.89) and
      test-retest reliability (p = 0.84 and 0.86). The questionnaire demonstrated
      adequate concurrent validity, with moderate correlations between food liking and 
      self-reported frequency of consumption (r = 0.19-0.39, ps < 0.05). This new Food 
      Liking Questionnaire assessing liking of a variety of savory and sweet foods
      demonstrated good psychometric properties in every validation step. This
      questionnaire will be useful to explore the role of food liking and its
      interactions with other factors in predicting eating behaviors and energy intake.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the use of oral Prednisolone and heparin
      versus the use of heparin alone in treatment of patients with unexplained
      recurrent miscarriage. METHODOLOGY: The study was a double-blind placebo
      randomized control trial conducted on 160 patients with unexplained recurrent
      miscarriage. Patients recruited were randomized into two groups. The first group 
      received oral Prednisolone in addition to low dose aspirin and heparin, while the
      other group received a placebo in addition to low dose aspirin and heparin. A
      peripheral venous blood sample was taken from all included patients before
      starting treatment and collected in heparinized tubes. Natural Killer (NK) cells 
      were checked in each sample and then re-checked in another sample at 20 weeks of 
      gestation. RESULTS: We found that in the prednisolone group, 70.3 % of women had 
      successful outcome (defined as an ongoing pregnancy beyond 20 weeks gestation),
      while 29.7 % miscarried before this gestation. On the contrary, among women in
      the placebo group, 9.2 % had successful outcome while 90.8 % miscarried before 20
      weeks, which was statistically significant. On the other hand, we found that
      there were no significant paired differences between initial serum levels of the 
      NK cells markers CD16 and CD56 and their levels at 20 weeks gestation in both
      groups. CONCLUSION: The addition of prednisolone to heparin and low dose aspirin 
      might be beneficial in patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, and this 
      effect might be due to a suppressive effect of steroids on the peripheral CD16 NK
      cells concentration.

TI  - An inhibitor of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, Nordy, induces differentiation and
      inhibits self-renewal of glioma stem-like cells.
PG  - 458-70
LID - 10.1007/s12015-010-9175-9 [doi]
AB  - Recent progress in cancer biology indicates that eradication of cancer stem cells
      (CSCs) is essential for more effective cancer therapy. Unfortunately, cancer stem
      cells such as glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs) are often resistant to either radio-
      or chemotherapy. Therefore, screening and development for novel therapeutic
      modalities against CSCs has been an important emerging field in cancer research. 
      In this study, we report that a synthetic dl-nordihydroguaiaretic acid compound
      (dl-NDGA or "Nordy"), inhibited self-renewal and induced differentiation of GSLCs
      in vitro and in vivo. We found that Nordy inhibited an enzyme known to be
      involved in leukemia stem cell and leukemia progression, Alox-5, and attenuated
      the growth of GSLCs in vitro. Nordy reduced the GSLC pool through a decrease in
      the CD133(+) population and abrogated clonogenicity. Nordy appeared to exert its 
      effect via astrocytic differentiation by up-regulation of GFAP and
      down-regulation of stemness related genes, rather than by inducing apoptosis of
      GSLCs. The growth inhibition of xenografted glioma by Nordy was more long-lasting
      compared with that of the akylating agent BCNU, which exhibited significant
      relapse on drug discontinuation resulting from an enrichment of GSLCs. Meanwhile,
      transient exposure to Nordy reduced tumorigenecity of GSLCs and induced
      differentiation of the xenografts. Taken together, we have identified Alox-5 as a
      novel target in GSLCs and its inhibition with Nordy exhibits therapeutic
      implications through inducing GSLC differentiation.

      as bortezomib can induce peripheral neuropathy and other toxicities that may
      compromise the ability to deliver therapy at full doses, thereby decreasing
      efficacy. One novel approach may be to target the immunoproteasome, a proteasomal
      variant found predominantly in cells of hematopoietic origin that differs from
      the constitutive proteasome found in most other cell types. Using purified
      preparations of constitutive and immunoproteasomes, we screened a rationally
      designed series of peptidyl-aldehydes and identified several with relative
      specificity for the immunoproteasome. The most potent immunoproteasome-specific
      inhibitor, IPSI-001, preferentially targeted the beta1(i) subunit of the
      immunoproteasome in vitro and in cellulo in a dose-dependent manner. This agent
      induced accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates, proapoptotic proteins, and 
      activated caspase-mediated apoptosis. IPSI-001 potently inhibited proliferation
      in myeloma patient samples and other hematologic malignancies. Importantly,
      IPSI-001 was able to overcome conventional and novel drug resistance, including
      resistance to bortezomib. These findings provide a rationale for the translation 
      of IPSIs to the clinic, where they may provide antimyeloma activity with greater 
      specificity and less toxicity than current inhibitors.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to measure people's accuracy when they
      estimate what proportion of their nightly sleep at home is supine vs. non-supine.
      METHODS: A series of patients referred for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      evaluation were asked if they "knew with confidence" how they slept with regard
      to their body position. "Yes" responders were then asked to estimate what
      percentage of their sleep was supine vs. non-supine. This value was compared with
      the actual proportion of supine vs. non-supine sleep that they exhibited in a
      home sleep test (HST) that followed. RESULTS: We obtained data from 49 subjects
      who expressed that they "knew with confidence" how they sleep in terms of body
      position. Subjects in aggregate underestimated their proportion of supine sleep
      by 21.6% (p < .001). Thirty-nine subjects (80%) slept supine more in the HST
      whereas 8 (16%) slept supine less compared to their pre-test estimates. Using a
      common classification of OSA severity, 9 subjects (18%) demonstrated a more
      severe degree of OSA than would have occurred had they slept as they had
      predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in this study frequently underestimated their
      proportion of supine sleep compared to values measured in an HST. Because of the 
      increased supine sleep they exhibited, the severity of their OSA was often
      greater in the test than it would have been had the subjects slept as they
      predicted. Sleep physicians should take into account the tendency of people to
      underestimate supine sleep. If patients with positional sleep apnea assert that
      they "always sleep laterally" when at home, they may be underestimating their
      true night-by-night OSA disease burden.

TI  - Factors associated with long-term speech and swallowing outcomes after
      chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer.
PG  - 1226-34
LID - 10.1001/archoto.2010.218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to identify factors that influence patient-centered measures of speech
      and swallowing function after successful use of chemoradiotherapy to treat
      cancers of the head and neck. DESIGN: patients previously enrolled in a phase 2
      trial using induction chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel
      followed by chemoradiotherapy with paclitaxel, fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and 1
      of 3 radiation dose levels were assigned speaking and swallowing scores at
      follow-up ranging from 1 to 4, with 1 representing normal speech or swallowing
      and 4 representing significant sustained deficits. PATIENTS: one hundred
      eighty-four patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: speech and swallowing function after chemoradiotherapy.
      RESULTS: of the 222 patients originally enrolled in the trial, 184 were alive and
      free of locoregional recurrence at the outset of this study. Of these eligible
      patients, 163 (88.6%) were assigned a speaking score of 1 through 4 at an average
      of 34.8 (range, 1.5-76.4) months after completion of treatment, whereas 166
      patients (90.2%) were assigned a swallowing score of 1 through 4 at an average of
      34.5 (range, 1.0-76.4) months after completion of treatment. Most patients (84.7%
      with speaking scores and 63.3% with swallowing scores) had no residual deficit
      and were assigned scores of 1. Factors that were associated with worse speaking
      outcomes included female sex, smoking history, hypopharyngeal or laryngeal
      primary sites, and poor response to induction chemotherapy; factors associated
      with worse swallowing outcomes included advanced patient age, poor performance
      status, primary site, and neck dissection. CONCLUSIONS: among patients
      successfully treated for locoregionally advanced cancers of the head and neck,
      several factors correlate with speaking and swallowing outcomes. Because advances
      in therapy have led to improved survival in these patients, understanding and
      controlling adverse effects of treatment should continue to be an active area of 
      investigation.

AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is a family of proteins that is implicated in many
      vital cellular functions such as stem cell regeneration and organogenesis.
      Several intra-cellular signal transduction pathways are induced by Wnt, notably
      the Wnt/beta-catenin dependent pathway or canonical pathway and the non-canonical
      or beta-catenin-independent pathway; the latter includes the Wnt/Ca2+and Planar
      Cell Polarity pathway (PCP). Wnt activation occurs at the intestinal crypt floor,
      and is critical to optimal maintenance of stem cells. Colorectal cancers show
      evidence of Wnt signaling pathway activation and this is associated with loss of 
      function of the tumor regulator APC. Wnt activation has been observed in breast, 
      lung, and hematopoietic malignancies and contributes to tumor recurrence. The Wnt
      pathway cross talks with the Notch and Sonic Hedgehog pathways, which has
      implications for therapeutic interventions in cancers. There are significant
      challenges in targeting the Wnt pathway, including finding agents that are
      efficacious without damaging the system of normal somatic stem cell function in
      cellular repair and tissue homeostasis. Here, we comprehensively review the Wnt
      pathway and its interactions with the Notch and Sonic Hedgehog pathways. We
      present the state of the field in effectors and inhibitors of Wnt signaling,
      including updates on clinical trials in various cancers with inhibitors of Wnt,
      Notch, and Sonic Hedgehog.

TI  - Studying the factors related to refractive error regression after PRK surgery.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1186/s12886-018-0879-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGTOUND: Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is used for a wide range of
      refractive errors such as low to moderate myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism.
      While many improvements have been made in laser application and accuracy as well 
      as the modes of corneal flap removal, and although the results are somewhat
      predictable, regression of refractive errors is still a common complaint among
      the patients undergoing refractive surgery with Excimer Laser. We aimed to
      determine related factors of regression following photorefractive keratectomy
      (PRK) in different types of refractive errors. METHODS: This cross-sectional
      study included patients who had undergone PRK more than 6 months previously and
      investigated refractive error regression and related factors. The participants
      were those who had PRK eye surgery for the first time from 2013 to 2016 using
      Technolas 217z100. A refraction value of spherical equivalent > 0.75 D after
      cycloplegic refraction was defined as refractive error regression. RESULTS: A
      total of 293 eyes on 150 subjects were studied. The preoperative refractive error
      of the eyes were as follows: 5.5% were myopic, 1% were hyperopic, 4.8% had
      astigmatism, 76% had myopic astigmatism and 12.6% had hyperopic astigmatism.
      Regressed and non-regressed eyes were assessed using the generalized estimating
      equations for the probabilistic variables of demographic characteristics,
      topography and eye refraction. The variables of simulated keratometry astigmatism
      (simK) (OR = 2.8; p = 0.04), 5 mm irregularity (OR = 3.56; p = 0.01) and sphere
      value (OR = 1.98; p = 0.01) were significantly related to refractive error
      regression. There was no significant relationship between the regressed and
      non-regressed eyes of the same person (p >/= 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was a
      positive relationship between the increase of 5 mm irregularity, simK, sphere
      value before surgery and refractive error regression. Age, sex and type of
      refraction error of the patient and the expertise of the PRK surgeon could change
      the general results; therefore, not all cases should be dealt with identically.

TI  - Translating the research in insulin injection technique: implications for
      practice.
PG  - 635-43
AB  - PURPOSE: Glucose variability leading to suboptimal glycemic control is common
      among people using injection therapies. Advanced technology and new studies have 
      identified important issues related to injection technique: needle length and
      gauge, body mass index, skin and subcutaneous tissue thickness, adequate
      resuspension of cloudy insulins, leakage, choice of injection site and rotation, 
      pinching a skinfold, and lipohypertrophy. All these issues can affect pain and
      bruising, insulin absorption, and blood glucose levels. The purpose of this
      article is to review current and past research regarding insulin injection
      therapy and to provide practical, translational information regarding injection
      technique, teaching/learning techniques specific to insulin administration, and
      implications for diabetes self-management education and support. CONCLUSION:
      International injection recommendations for patients with diabetes have recently 
      been published and have identified specific recommendations for health care
      professionals. This article provides an evidence-based translational and
      practical review of the research regarding injection technique and
      teaching/learning theory. Diabetes educators need to reevaluate how they provide 
      instruction for the administration of insulin and other injectable medications.
      Research regarding skin and subcutaneous thickness reveals that shorter needles
      may be appropriate for the majority of patients regardless of body mass index.
      Periodic reassessment of injection technique, including suspension of cloudy
      insulins and inspection of injection sites for lipohypertrophy, is a critical
      aspect of the role of the diabetes educator. An injection checklist is provided
      as a guide for diabetes educators.

AB  - Among the multitude of papers published yearly in scientific journals, precious
      few publications may be worth looking back in half a century to appreciate the
      significance of the discoveries that would later become common knowledge and get 
      a chance to shape a field or several adjacent fields. Here, Kimura's fundamental 
      concept of neutral mutation-random drift, which was published 50 years ago, is
      re-examined in light of its pervasive influence on comparative genomics and, more
      specifically, on the contribution of transposable elements to eukaryotic genome
      evolution.

      The standard fatty acids were derivatized with DBD-PZ-NH2 (D) to the stable
      isotope-labeled compounds for the fatty acids derivatives of DBD-PZ-NH2 and used 
      for the internal standards. The obtained calibration curves for fatty acids were 
      linear over the range 0.1-200 microM (r2 > 0.999). Fatty acids in plasma samples 
      were determined after derivatization with DBD-PZ-NH2 and analyzed by LC/MS using 
      standard fatty acid DBD-PZ-NH2 (D) derivatives as internal standards.
      Furthermore, the relative amounts of fatty acids in two plasma samples were
      determined after derivatization with DBD-PZ-NH2 and DBD-PZ-NH2) (D). The
      isotope-labeled derivatization reagent was useful for accurate quantification and
      the determination of relative amounts of the metabolites in biological samples
      having the target functional group.

TI  - Rapid, accurate, and non-invasive measurement of zebrafish axial length and other
      eye dimensions using SD-OCT allows longitudinal analysis of myopia and
      emmetropization.
PG  - e110699
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0110699 [doi]
AB  - Refractive errors in vision can be caused by aberrant axial length of the eye,
      irregular corneal shape, or lens abnormalities. Causes of eye length overgrowth
      include multiple genetic loci, and visual parameters. We evaluate zebrafish as a 
      potential animal model for studies of the genetic, cellular, and signaling basis 
      of emmetropization and myopia. Axial length and other eye dimensions of zebrafish
      were measured using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). We
      used ocular lens and body metrics to normalize and compare eye size and relative 
      refractive error (difference between observed retinal radial length and controls)
      in wild-type and lrp2 zebrafish. Zebrafish were dark-reared to assess effects of 
      visual deprivation on eye size. Two relative measurements, ocular axial length to
      body length and axial length to lens diameter, were found to accurately normalize
      comparisons of eye sizes between different sized fish (R2=0.9548, R2=0.9921).
      Ray-traced focal lengths of wild-type zebrafish lenses were equal to their
      retinal radii, while lrp2 eyes had longer retinal radii than focal lengths. Both 
      genetic mutation (lrp2) and environmental manipulation (dark-rearing) caused
      elongated eye axes. lrp2 mutants had relative refractive errors of -0.327
      compared to wild-types, and dark-reared wild-type fish had relative refractive
      errors of -0.132 compared to light-reared siblings. Therefore, zebrafish eye
      anatomy (axial length, lens radius, retinal radius) can be rapidly and accurately
      measured by SD-OCT, facilitating longitudinal studies of regulated eye growth and
      emmetropization. Specifically, genes homologous to human myopia candidates may be
      modified, inactivated or overexpressed in zebrafish, and myopia-sensitizing
      conditions used to probe gene-environment interactions. Our studies provide
      foundation for such investigations into genetic contributions that control eye
      size and impact refractive errors.

      Synthesis.
PG  - 216435

AB  - Lipase from Candida rugosa (CRL) was immobilized by covalent attachment on
      hydrous niobium oxide. The matrix could effectively be attached to the enzyme
      with high retention of activity and prevent its leakage. Following
      immobilization, CRL exhibited improved storage stability and performed better at 
      higher incubation temperatures. In addition, the enzyme retained most of its
      catalytic efficiency after successive operational cycles. The immobilized
      derivative was also fully characterized with respect to its morphological
      properties: particle size, surface specific area, and pore size distribution.
      Structural integrity and conformational changes, such as surface cavities in the 
      support, set by the lipase procedure, were observed by Scanning Electron
      Microscopy. Additionally, a comparative study between free and immobilized
      lipases was provided in terms of pH, temperature, and thermal stability. CRL
      derivative was evaluated for the synthesis of biodiesel employing babassu oil and
      short chain alcohols. The process was feasible only for oil and butanol reaction 
      system.

LID - 10.1016/j.brachy.2013.09.011 [doi]
LID - S1538-4721(13)00354-1 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are the most common soft tissue tumors in the
      pediatric population. The American Brachytherapy Society provides recommendations
      for the use of brachytherapy (BRT) in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas; yet,
      there are no clearly defined recommendations for the use of adjuvant BRT in
      treating RMSs in particular. Radiation therapy has an important role in
      maximizing local control, and BRT has the advantage over external beam radiation 
      therapy of providing a high dose of radiation to the most susceptible area of
      recurrence, while delivering a lower dose to the surrounding normal tissue.
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study examines a group of 8 pediatric patients with
      RMSs who were treated with temporary low-dose-rate (125)I BRT and investigates
      the efficacy and side effects of such treatment. RESULTS: The results demonstrate
      a local recurrence rate of 12.5%, with minimal side effects occurring in the
      patients who had no prior radiation history. Each patient's side effects are
      discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The high efficacy and ease of radiation protection for
      visitors establishes this as an effective treatment that is logistically
      convenient for patients and families. This is the first report of patients
      exclusively with RMSs being treated exclusively with (125)I BRT and demonstrates 
      promising results.

AB  - A coupled Bio-EF treatment has been applied as a reliable process for the
      degradation of the pharmaceuticals furosemide (FRSM) and ranitidine (RNTD) in
      aqueous medium, in order to reduce the high energy consumption related to
      electrochemical technology. In the first stage of this study, electrochemical
      degradation of the drugs was assessed by the electro-Fenton process (EF) using a 
      BDD/carbon-felt cell. Biodegradability of the drugs solutions was enhanced
      reaching BOD5/COD ratios close to the biodegradability threshold of 0.4,
      evidencing the formation of bio-compatible by-products (mainly short-chain
      carboxylic acids) which are suitable for biological post-treatment. Moreover,
      toxicity evaluation by the Microtox((R)) method revealed that EF pre-treatment
      was able of detoxifying both, FRSM and RNTD solutions, constituting another
      indicator of biodegradability of EF treated solutions. In the second stage,
      electrolyzed solutions were treated by means of an aerobic biological process. A 
      significant part of the short-chain carboxylic acids formed during the
      electrochemical phase was satisfactorily removed by the used selected
      microorganisms. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility
      of the integrated Bio-EF process.

TI  - Promoter methylation reduces C/EBPdelta (CEBPD) gene expression in the SUM-52PE
      human breast cancer cell line and in primary breast tumors.
PG  - 161-70
AB  - CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Proteins (C/EBPs) are a highly conserved family of leucine
      zipper proteins that regulate cell growth and differentiation. C/EBPdelta
      functions in the initiation and maintenance of mammary epithelial cell G(0)
      growth arrest and 'loss of function' alterations in C/EBPdelta gene expression
      have been reported in human breast cancer and in rodent carcinogen-induced
      mammary tumors. The molecular mechanism underlying reduced C/EBPdelta gene
      expression in mammary tumorigenesis, however, is unknown. In this report we
      demonstrate that C/EBPdelta gene expression is undetectable in the SUM-52PE human
      breast cancer cell line and that silencing of SUM-52PE C/EBPdelta gene expression
      is due to epigenetic promoter hypermethylation (26/27 CpGs methylated). The
      hypermethylated SUM-52PE C/EBPdelta gene promoter is associated with reduced
      levels of acetylated Histone H4, consistent with a closed, transcriptionally
      inactive chromatin conformation. Treatment with 5'-aza-cytidine and trichostatin 
      A (TSA) re-activates cytokine-induced SUM-52PE C/EBPdelta gene expression.
      C/EBPdelta gene expression is reduced to virtually undetectable levels in 32%
      (18/57) of primary human breast tumors. Site-specific CpG methylation was
      observed in 33% (6/18) of the low C/EBPdelta expressing primary breast tumors.
      CpG methylation adjacent to the C/EBPdelta proximal promoter Sp1 site was
      associated with reduced C/EBPdelta expression in a primary breast cancer sample. 
      Electromobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrated a significant reduction in
      binding to oligos containing the CpG methylation 5' to the Sp1 binding site.
      These results demonstrate a direct link between C/EBPdelta gene promoter hyper-
      and site specific-methylation and reduced C/EBPdelta gene expression in breast
      cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors.

TI  - Arginine, N-carbamylglutamate, and glutamine exert protective effects against
      oxidative stress in rat intestine.
PG  - 242-248
LID - 10.1016/j.aninu.2016.04.005 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the current study is to evaluate the effects of dietary
      supplementation with arginine (ARG), N-carbamylglutamate (NCG), and glutamine
      (GLN) on rat intestinal morphology and antioxidant status under oxidative stress.
      Rats were fed for 30 d with one of the following iso-nitrogenous diets: basal
      diet (BD), BD plus 1% ARG, BD plus 0.1% NCG, and BD plus 1% GLN. On day 28, half 
      of the rats fed BD were intraperitoneally injected with 12 mg/kg body weight of
      diquat (DT; i.e., the DT group) and the other half was intraperitoneally injected
      with sterile solution (i.e., the control group). The other diet groups were
      intraperitoneally injected with 12 mg/kg body weight of DT (i.e., DT + 1% GLN [DT
      + GLN], DT + 1% ARG [DT + ARG], and DT + 0.1% NCG [DT + NCG]). Rat jejunum
      samples obtained at 48 h after DT injection were analyzed. Results showed that DT
      significantly decreased catalase (CAT) activity and glutathione (GSH) content by 
      58.25% and 56.57%, respectively, and elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) content and
      crypt depth (CD) by 19.39% and 22.13%, respectively, in the jejunum (P < 0.05,
      relative to the control group). Compared with the DT group, the DT + GLN group
      exhibited significantly improved villus height (VH), villus width (VW), villus
      surface area (VSA), CD and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity (P <
      0.05); the DT + ARG group exhibited significantly increased the ratio of VH to CD
      (H:D) and T-AOC activity (P < 0.05); the DT + GLN, DT + ARG and DT + NCG groups
      exhibited significantly enhanced CAT activity and GSH content as well as
      decreased MDA content (P < 0.05). Moreover, VH, VW, VSA, CD and GSH content in
      the DT + GLN group were higher whereas MDA content was lower compared with the
      corresponding values observed in both the DT + ARG and the DT + NCG groups (P <
      0.05). The H:D ratio in the DT + ARG group significantly increased compared with 
      that in the DT + NCG and DT + GLN groups (P < 0.05). Collectively, this study
      suggested that dietary supplementation with 1% GLN, 0.1% NCG, and 1% ARG was
      effective in enhancing the antioxidant status and maintaining the morphological
      structure of rat jejunum under oxidative stress; of these supplements, 1% GLN
      exerted the greatest effects on mitigating oxidative stress.

TI  - Electroacupuncture frequency-related transcriptional response in rat arcuate
      nucleus revealed region-distinctive changes in response to low- and
      high-frequency electroacupuncture.
PG  - 1464-73
LID - 10.1002/jnr.23028 [doi]
AB  - Electroacupuncture (EA) has been clinically applied for treating different
      medical conditions, such as pain, strain, and immune diseases. Low- and
      high-frequency EAs have distinct therapeutic effects in clinical practice and
      experimental studies. However, the molecular mechanism of this difference remains
      obscure. The arcuate nucleus (Arc) is a critical region of the hypothalamus and
      is responsible for the effect of EA stimulation to remote acupoints. Gene
      expression profiling provides a powerful tool with which to explore the basis of 
      physiopathological responses to external stimulus. In this study, using cDNA
      microarray, we investigated gene expressions in the rat Arc region induced by
      low-frequency (2-Hz) and high-frequency (100-Hz) EAs to two remote acupoints,
      zusanli (ST36) and sanyinjiao (SP6). We have found that more genes were
      differentially regulated by 2-Hz EA than 100-Hz EA (154 vs. 66 regulated
      genes/ESTs) in Arc, especially those related to neurogenesis, which was confirmed
      by qRT-PCR. These results demonstrate that the expression level of genes in the
      Arc region could be effectively regulated by low-frequency EA, compared with
      high-frequency EA, helping to uncover the mechanisms of the therapeutic effects
      of the low-frequency EA. Our results also indicate different-frequency EAs are
      spatially specific.

TI  - Challenges and perspectives in commercializing plastid transformation technology.
PG  - 5945-5960
AB  - Plastid transformation has emerged as an alternative platform to generate
      transgenic plants. Attractive features of this technology include specific
      integration of transgenes-either individually or as operons-into the plastid
      genome through homologous recombination, the potential for high-level protein
      expression, and transgene containment because of the maternal inheritance of
      plastids. Several issues associated with nuclear transformation such as gene
      silencing, variable gene expression due to the Mendelian laws of inheritance, and
      epigenetic regulation have not been observed in the plastid genome. Plastid
      transformation has been successfully used for the production of therapeutics,
      vaccines, antigens, and commercial enzymes, and for engineering various agronomic
      traits including resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, these
      demonstrations have usually focused on model systems such as tobacco, and the
      technology per se has not yet reached the market. Technical factors limiting this
      technology include the lack of efficient protocols for the transformation of
      cereals, poor transgene expression in non-green plastids, a limited number of
      selection markers, and the lengthy procedures required to recover fully
      segregated plants. This article discusses the technology of transforming the
      plastid genome, the positive and negative features compared with nuclear
      transformation, and the current challenges that need to be addressed for
      successful commercialization.

TI  - Incidence of chaotic eating behaviors in binge-eating disorder: contributing
      factors.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - Because dieting is not as common in patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) as 
      among patients with bulimia or anorexia nervosa, the authors assessed the
      incidence, frequency, and contributing factors of semistarvation-like eating
      patterns in BED patients in this study, the first to explore such behaviors in a 
      clinical population. They administered the Semistarvation-Associated Behaviors
      Scale (SSABS) to 54 women seeking BED treatment and to 29 controls. The aberrant 
      eating behaviors among BED clients were associated with current dieting and
      certain BED criteria, (p < .05). The strongest contributor to chaotic eating
      patterns was negative affect preceding BED (r = .45, p < .001). This finding
      highlights the behavioral psychopathology of BED and strengthens the role of
      negative affect in precipitating binge episodes associated with the disorder.
      These behaviors may help maintain BED by creating a binge-negative affect cycle. 
      The SSABS is a tool that may help break this cycle.

TI  - Crystal structures and in-situ formation study of mayenite electrides.
PG  - 4167-76
AB  - Mayenite inorganic electrides are antizeolite nanoporous materials with variable 
      electron concentration [Ca12Al14O32]2+ square5-deltaO1-delta2-e2delta- (0 < delta
      < or = 1), where square stands for empty sites. The oxymayenite crystal structure
      contains positively charged cages where loosely bounded oxide anions are located.
      These oxygens can be removed to yield electron-loaded materials in which the
      electrons behave like anions (electrides). Here, a new preparation method, which 
      allows synthesizing powder mayenite electrides easily, is reported. Accurate
      structural data for the white (delta = 0) and green electride (delta
      approximately 0.5) are reported from joint Rietveld refinements of neutron and
      synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data and also from single-crystal
      diffraction. The electride formation at high temperature under vacuum has been
      followed in-situ by neutron powder diffraction. The evolution of mayenite crystal
      structure, including the changes in the key occupation factor of the intracage
      oxide anions, is reported. Furthermore, the stability of mayenite framework in
      very low oxygen partial pressure conditions is also studied. It has been found
      that C12A7 decomposes, at 1373 K in reducing conditions, to give Ca5Al6O14 (C5A3)
      and Ca3Al2O6 (C3A). The kinetics of this transformation has also been studied.
      The fit of the transformed fraction to the classic Avrami-Erofe'ev equation gave 
      an "Avrami exponent", n = 2, which indicates that nucleation is fast and the
      two-dimensional linear growth of the new phases is likely to be the limiting
      factor.

TI  - [The new preschool examination in Baden-Wuerttemberg: what determinants influence
      the school medical evaluation special need for language promotion in childhood
      development?].
PG  - 838-47
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1345197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The new examination before primary school enrollment in
      Baden-Wuerttemberg aims at detecting problems in infant development with regard
      to later school success in time to initiate supporting measures, especially to
      improve the language skills of children with other native languages. By a 2-level
      process composed of a screening of language skills (HASE and KVS) and an
      additional test (SETK 3-5) of children who did not pass the screening, the school
      physicians attested special needs for language promotion in the kindergarten.
      This study looked for associated risks of children with special needs for
      language promotion. The degree of test quality of the 2-level process for
      identifying special needs for language promotion was determined. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: This cross-sectional analysis explored findings of n=80,781 children in 
      the new examination before primary school enrollment of the data-set of
      Baden-Wuerttemberg (children with school enrollment 2011). 56,352 children
      (69.8%) were speaking German, 24,429 children (30.2%) had other family languages.
      20,461 children (25.3%) had special needs for language promotion in the
      kindergarten. A logistic regression model to determine main risks of special
      needs for language promotion was developed. Main effects were other native
      languages (OR 5.1 [4.8; 5.2]), problems in subitising (OR 2.8 [2.7; 3.0]) and
      language development lags in the questionnaire of the nursery school teachers (OR
      3.5 [3.3; 3.7]). Protective effects were an elevated graduation of the mother (OR
      0.7 [0.7; 0.7]) or the father (OR 0.8 [0.7; 0.8]). Risk scores of the effects
      were defined. The corresponding predictive probability to different levels of
      risk scores was calculated. The true positive rate of the screening of language
      skills (HASE/KVS) in regard to special needs for language promotion was 0.95, the
      true negative rate was 0.72 and the -positive predictive value was 0.53. The
      school physician's findings of special needs for language promotion acted as gold
      standard. With the additional test (SETK 3-5) the positive predictive value
      improved to 0.9, if at least one of the subtests of the SETK 3-5 was not passed. 
      The risk score-level corresponded with the pretest-probability and the
      consecutive positive predictive value of the screening of language skills.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an adequate degree of test quality of the 2-level 
      process in the new examination before primary school enrollment in
      Baden-Wuerttemberg (screening of language skills and additional test, if the
      screening is not passed). In addition children with special needs for language
      promotion had associated risks. Risk scores, that have been defined, offer an
      information tool to the school physicians concerning the positive predictive
      value of the screening of language skills without additional testing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microalbuminuria (MA), a marker of renal microvascular disease, is
      associated with brain atrophy and neurovascular changes in older adults with type
      2 diabetes mellitus (DM). We evaluated the relationship between urine
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and regional brain volumes to determine
      whether subclinical albuminuria may indicate early structural brain changes in
      type 2 DM. MATERIALS/METHODS: We studied UACR and brain volumes in 85 type 2 DM
      patients (64.8+/-8.3years) and 40 age-matched controls using 3D magnetization
      prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MP-RAGE) MRI (magnetic resonance
      imaging) at 3 Tesla. The relationship between UACR and brain volumes was analyzed
      using the least square models. RESULTS: In DM patients, UACR >/=5mg/g, UACR
      >/=10mg/g and clinically significant MA (UACR >/=17mg/g [males] and 25mg/g
      [females]) were associated with lower gray matter (GM) volume in the frontal lobe
      (r(2)adj=0.2-0.4, P=0.01-0.05) and UACR >/=5mg/g was also related to global GM
      atrophy (r(2)adj=0.1, P=0.04), independent of DM duration, glucose levels, HbA1c 
      and hypertension. For UACR >/=5mg/g, a lower global GM volume was related to
      worse executive function (P=0.04) in the DM group. No associations were found for
      UACR (<5mg/g) and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical albuminuria (UACR >/=5mg/g) 
      is associated with lower GM volume that has clinical impact on cognitive function
      in older diabetic patients, and these relationships are independent of DM control
      and hypertension. Therefore, UACR levels may serve as an additional marker of
      DM-related brain structural changes.

TI  - Photopolymerization of highly filled dimethacrylate-based composites using Type I

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The use of a Type I photoinitiator (monoacylphosphine oxide, MAPO)
      was described as advantageous in a model formulation, as compared to the
      conventional Type II photoinitiator (Camphorquinone, CQ). The aim of the present 
      work was to study the kinetics of polymerization of various composite mixtures
      (20-40-60-80 mol%) of bisphenol A glycidyl dimethacrylate/triethylene glycol
      dimethacrylate (BisGMA/TegDMA) containing either CQ or MAPO, based on real-time
      measurements and on the characterization of various post-cure characteristics.
      METHODS: Polymerization kinetics were monitored by Fourier-transform
      near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) and dielectric analysis (DEA). A range of
      postcure properties was also investigated. RESULTS: FT-NIRS and DEA proved
      complementary to follow the fast kinetics observed with both systems.
      Autodecceleration occurred after approximately 1 s irradiation for
      MAPO-composites and approximately 5-10 s for CQ-composites. Conversion decreased 
      with increasing initial viscosity for both photoinitiating systems. However
      despite shorter light exposure (3s for MAPO vs 20s for CQ-composites),
      MAPO-composites yielded higher conversions for all co-monomer mixtures, except at
      20 mol% BisGMA, the less viscous material. MAPO systems were associated with
      increased amounts of trapped free radicals, improved flexural strength and
      modulus, and reduced free monomer release for all co-monomer ratios, except at 20
      mol% BisGMA. SIGNIFICANCE: This work confirms the major influence of the
      initiation system both on the conversion and network cross-linking of
      highly-filled composites, and further highlights the advantages of using MAPO
      photoinitiating systems in highly-filled dimethacrylate-based composites provided
      that sufficient BisGMA content (>40 mol%) and adapted light spectrum are used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) remain at high risk for future
      events despite medical and device therapy. Dietary sodium reduction is often
      recommended based on limited evidence. However, it is not known whether dietary
      sodium reduction reduces the morbidity or mortality associated with HF. METHODS: 
      The SODIUM study is a pragmatic, randomized, open-label trial assessing the
      efficacy of dietary sodium reduction to <1500 mg daily counseling compared to
      usual care for patients with chronic HF. The intervention is provided by trained 
      personnel at the site and uses 3-day food records for directing counseling. The
      primary outcome is an intention-to-treat analysis on the time to first
      cardiovascular event or death measured at 12 months. Secondary end points include
      the change in quality of life (using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy
      Questionnaire), change in New York Heart Association class, and change in
      6-minute walk test. The first patient was enrolled in March 2014, and
      subsequently, 27 sites in 6 countries enrolled patients. CONCLUSIONS: The
      SODIUM-HF trial will provide a robust evaluation of the effects of dietary sodium
      reduction in patients with HF. Results are expected in 2020.

TI  - Acylated and nonacylated ghrelin levels and their associations with insulin
      resistance in obese and normal weight children with metabolic syndrome.
PG  - 861-70
LID - 10.1530/EJE-09-0375 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghrelin, a peptide mainly derived from the stomach, plays a pivotal
      role in the regulation of food intake, energy metabolism, and storage, as well as
      in insulin sensitivity. Ghrelin circulates in acylated (A-Ghr) and nonacylated
      (NA-Ghr) forms, and their potential differential associations with insulin
      resistance (IR) in childhood obesity remain undefined. OBJECTIVE: We investigated
      the associations of ghrelin forms with IR in normal weight and obese children and
      the impact of metabolic syndrome (MS) on their plasma values. DESIGN: A total of 
      210 children in four subgroups of normal weight/obese children with and without
      components of MS were studied. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and
      acylated and total ghrelin were examined. IR was determined by a homeostasis
      model assessment (HOMA) of IR. RESULTS: In the entire population, plasma insulin 
      and HOMA-IR were associated negatively with T-Ghr and NA-Ghr, but positively with
      the ratio of A/NA-Ghr after adjustment for age, gender, and Tanner stage. Obese
      metabolically abnormal children had lower T-Ghr and NA-Ghr, but comparable A-Ghr 
      and a higher A/NA-Ghr ratio than obese metabolically normal subjects. Compared
      with lean healthy children, lean metabolically abnormal subjects had higher A-Ghr
      and the A/NA-Ghr ratio, but comparable T-Ghr and NA-Ghr. A multiple regression
      analysis showed that A-Ghr and the A/NA-Ghr ratios were positively associated
      with HOMA-IR, independent of age, gender, Tanner stage, and body mass index (or
      waist circumference) and other components of MS. CONCLUSIONS: A-Ghr excess may
      negatively modulate insulin action in obese and nonobese children, and may
      contribute to the association of IR and MS.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an increasing public health concern with an 
      estimated 184 million people infected worldwide and approximately 350,000 deaths 
      yearly from HCV-related complications. There is a compelling medical need for new
      anti-HCV therapeutic agents that are potent, tolerable, safe, completely oral and
      with shorter treatment duration. To this end, a plethora of direct-acting
      antivirals have been developed and regulatory authorities have approved nine new 
      molecules for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). In January 2016, the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the fixed-dose combination medication 
      incorporating the NS3/NS4A inhibitor grazoprevir (formerly MK-5172) and the NS5A 
      inhibitor elbasvir (formerly MK-8742), with or without ribavirin, for the
      treatment of CHC genotypes 1 and 4 infection in adult patients. This all-oral
      combination has proven potent and safe even in patients with advanced kidney
      disease. Herein, we review the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety
      profile pertaining to grazoprevir/elbasvir fixed-dose combination for CHC.

TI  - Influence of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator on gene
      expression in response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of human bronchial
      epithelial cells.
PG  - 6822-30
AB  - Chronic lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes significant morbidity in 
      cystic fibrosis patients initiated by the failure of innate immune responses. We 
      used microarray analysis and real-time PCR to detect transcriptional changes
      associated with cytokine production in isogenic bronchial epithelial cell lines
      with either wild-type (WT) or mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
      regulator (CFTR) in response to P. aeruginosa infection. The transcription of
      four NF-kappaB-regulated cytokine genes was maximal in the presence of WT CFTR:
      the interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6, CXCL1, and intracellular adhesion molecule 1
      (ICAM-1) genes. Analysis of protein expression in two cell lines paired for
      wild-type and mutant CFTR with three P. aeruginosa strains showed IL-6 and IL-8
      expressions were consistently enhanced by the presence of WT CFTR in both cell
      lines with all three strains of P. aeruginosa, although some strains gave small
      IL-8 increases in cells with mutant CFTR. CXCL1 production showed consistent
      enhancement in cells with WT CFTR using all three bacterial strains in one cell
      line, whereas in the other cell line, CXCL1 showed a significant increase in
      cells with either WT or mutant CFTR. ICAM-1 was unchanged at the protein level in
      one of the cell lines but did show mild enhancement with WT CFTR in the other
      cell pair. Inhibitions of NF-kappaB prior to infection indicated differing
      degrees of dependence on NF-kappaB for production of the cytokines, contingent on
      the cell line. Cytokine effectors of innate immunity to P. aeruginosa were found 
      to be positively influenced by the presence of WT CFTR, indicating a role in
      resistance to P. aeruginosa infection.

TI  - Factors Associated With New-Onset Depression Following Ischemic Stroke: The
      Women's Health Initiative.
LID - e003828 [pii]
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.116.003828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial characteristics have a strong effect on risk of
      depression, and their direct treatment with behavioral interventions reduces
      rates of depression. Because new-onset poststroke depression (NPSD) is frequent, 
      devastating, and often treatment-resistant, novel preventive efforts are needed. 
      As a first step toward developing behavioral interventions for NPSD, we
      investigated whether prestroke psychosocial factors influenced rates of NPSD in a
      manner similar to the general population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the Women's 
      Health Initiative, we analyzed 1424 respondents who were stroke-free at
      enrollment and had no self-reported history of depression from enrollment to
      their nonfatal ischemic stroke based on initiation of treatment for depression or
      the Burnam screening instrument for detecting depressive disorders. NPSD was
      assessed using the same method during the 5-year poststroke period. Logistic
      regression provided odds ratios of NPSD controlling for multiple covariates. NPSD
      occurred in 21.4% (305/1424) of the analytic cohort and varied by stroke severity
      as measured by the Glasgow scale, ranging from 16.7% of those with good recovery 
      to 31.6% of those severely disabled. Women with total anterior circulation
      infarction had the highest level (31.4%) of NPSD while those with lacunar
      infarction had the lowest (16.1%). Prestroke psychosocial measures had different 
      associations with NPSD depending on functional recovery of the individual.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a difference in the relationship of prestroke psychosocial 
      status and risk of NPSD depending on stroke severity; thus it may be that the
      same preventive interventions might not work for all stroke patients. One size
      does not fit all.

PG  - 121-7
AB  - An evaluation of fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) to detect antibodies
      against Brucella melitensis according to the Mexican Official Norm (NOM) was
      performed. In this study, a total of 2582 goat serum samples from a
      high-prevalence area in northeast Mexico where vaccination is applied, were used.
      Of these, 1094 were classified as NOM negatives (card test (CT) negatives or CT
      positives/complement fixation test (CFT) negatives) and 1488 as NOM positives (CT
      and CFT positives). The receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis
      was used to obtain the FPA sensitivity (83.5%), specificity (82.2%) and accuracy 
      (88.2%) compared with NOM criteria, using a cut-off value of 89mP for positive
      samples. In addition, FPA produced 84.1% of negative results versus 65.7% of CT
      using 1094 CFT negative samples, which indicated that FPA performance was better 
      than CT to detect negative samples or differentiate samples from vaccinated
      animals. Finally, FPA showed 95.8% sensitivity when using 702 negative
      non-vaccinated samples. Taken together, these results suggested that FPA might
      replace CT as a screening test for its better performance compared with CFT, its 
      adjustable cut-off useful in different epidemiological situations, and for its
      reliability, ease of performance, comparable cost with CT regimen, and potential 
      application in field and high-throughput laboratories. The use of FPA as
      screening test will help to reduce the percentage of goats wrongly slaughtered
      because of brucellosis misdiagnosis. More studies on FPA are required for its
      approval as diagnostic tool for goat brucellosis.

TI  - Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor: Three Ligands, Many Actions.
PG  - 9-19
AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of a family of neurotrophins
      which include nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3, and neurotrophin 4. Studies
      over the last three decades have identified mature BDNF as a key regulator of
      neuronal differentiation, structure, and function; actions mediated by the TrkB
      receptor. More recently identified isoforms which are translated from the bdnf
      gene, including the uncleaved precursor, pro-BDNF, and the cleaved prodomain,
      have been found to elicit opposing functions in neurons through the activation of
      distinct receptors. This work emphasizes the critical roles for all three
      isoforms of BDNF in modulating neuronal activity that impact complex human
      behaviors including memory, anxiety, depression, and hyperphagia.

AB  - Despite knowledge that polyploidy is widespread and a major evolutionary force in
      flowering plant diversification, detailed comparative molecular studies on
      polyploidy have been confined to only a few species and families. The genus Oryza
      is composed of 23 species that are classified into ten distinct 'genome types'
      (six diploid and four polyploid), and is emerging as a powerful new model system 
      to study polyploidy. Here we report the identification, sequence and
      comprehensive comparative annotation of eight homoeologous genomes from a single 
      orthologous region (Adh1-Adh2) from four allopolyploid species representing each 
      of the known Oryza genome types (BC, CD, HJ and KL). Detailed comparative
      phylogenomic analyses of these regions within and across species and ploidy
      levels provided several insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of genome
      organization and evolution of this region in 'natural' polyploids of Oryza. The
      major findings of this study are that: (i) homoeologous genomic regions within
      the same nucleus experience both independent and parallel evolution, (ii)
      differential lineage-specific selection pressures do not occur between polyploids
      and their diploid progenitors, (iii) there have been no dramatic structural
      changes relative to the diploid ancestors, (iv) a variation in the molecular
      evolutionary rate exists between the two genomes in the BC complex species even
      though the BC and CD polyploid species appear to have arisen <2 million years
      ago, and (v) there are no clear distinctions in the patterns of genome evolution 
      in the diploid versus polyploid species.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of both type 1 and type 2
      diabetes. DN is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease, and it markedly
      enhances the risk of cardiovascular events. An elevated urinary albumin excretion
      rate, increased blood pressure (BP), and a continual loss of renal function are
      characteristics of DN. Screening for microalbuminuria is central to diabetes
      care, and antihypertensive agents are used for the primary prevention and
      treatment of DN. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II
      receptor blockers play central roles and have protective properties beyond their 
      BP-lowering effects. BP control in relation to DN is the main focus of this
      review, but tight control of the glucose level is equally important. There is an 
      unmet need for new treatment options, and while a few promising candidates exist,
      their roles in clinical practice have not yet been determined.

TI  - 'Marge': a European Elderberry for North American Producers.
PG  - 191-199
AB  - Elderberries are being increasingly produced and consumed in North America for
      their edible and medicinal flowers and fruits. The American elderberry (Sambucus 
      nigra subsp. canadensis) is native to, and most often cultivated in North
      America. The European elderberry (S. nigra subsp. nigra) has been developed into 
      an economically-important horticultural crop in Europe, but most European
      cultivars do not perform well in the midwestern USA. The genotype S. nigra subsp.
      nigra 'Marge' is an open-pollinated seedling of S. nigra subsp. nigra
      'Haschberg', which is one of the most popular elderberry cultivars grown in
      Europe. In a four-year study (one establishment year followed by 3 production
      years; 2008-2011) at three Missouri (USA) locations, 'Marge' significantly
      out-performed and out-yielded eight American elderberry genotypes within the same
      replicated field plots. Across 3 production years at all three sites, 'Marge'
      achieved budbreak later, flowered earlier, suffered less Eriophyid mite damage,
      was taller, produced larger berries, and yielded significantly greater amounts of
      fruit compared with all eight American elderberry genotypes in the study. At one 
      site, 'Marge' produced three times the yield (1.89 kg/plant) compared with the
      next highest-producing American elderberry genotype (0.65 kg/plant). It is an
      exceptionally robust and drought-resistant elderberry. The phenotypic attributes 
      of 'Marge' are similar to that of European elderberry except that it performs
      exceptionally well in the midwestern USA. DNA marker results, along with
      phenological and morphological characteristics, indicate that 'Marge' is a
      European elderberry (S. nigra subsp. nigra). As with most European genotypes,
      'Marge' does not fruit on first-year wood, and will therefore require a different
      pruning regimen compared with American elderberry for success in North American
      production. We do not yet know how 'Marge' will perform outside the midwestern
      USA, but it is so productive, unique, and mite resistant, that it merits
      introduction as a cultivar.

TI  - Cloning of idiotype immunoglobulin genes in B cell lymphomas by anchored PCR and 
      production of individual recombinant idiotype vaccines in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 395-402
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Individual immunoglobulins expressed by B-cell lymphomas represent
      tumor-specific antigens ('idiotypes'). Immunization with idiotype in follicular
      lymphoma patients may induce specific immune responses, sustained
      progression-free survival, and disappearance of minimal residual disease.
      Manufacturing of idiotype vaccines has mostly relied on heterohybridomas
      established from viable lymphoma cells. This paper describes the feasibility of
      production of GMP-grade idiotype vaccines as recombinant Fab fragments in
      Escherichia coli. METHODS: IgH and IgL transcripts were analyzed by anchored PCR 
      from 106 lymphoma and nine control biopsies. Lymphoma-derived V segments were
      inserted into prokaryotic expression plasmids. Recombinant idiotype Fab fragments
      were expressed in E. coli in a fermentation system. RESULTS: Idiotype IgH and IgL
      transcripts were identified in 95% of 106 lymphoma biopsies according to
      stringent clonality criteria. Large-scale idiotype expression was successful in
      69 of 78 cases (89%) and yielded a median of 17 mg (range: 1.2-250 mg)
      recombinant Fab protein. After affinity chromatography, median vaccine purity was
      99% heterodimeric Fab protein (range: 72-100%). Bacterial protein contamination
      was detectable in one vaccine only. Fab proteins with IgL lambda chains had a
      tendency for inferior yield and lesser purity than kappa-type Fabs. Among other
      structural idiotype features (isotype, V family usage, somatic hypermutation
      pattern, novel glycosylation sites, CDR III net charge), no consistent influences
      on Fab yield or purity were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Anchored PCR cloning and
      subsequent protein expression in E. coli provides a reliable technological basis 
      for clinical idiotype vaccination trials.

TI  - Exposing the Causal Effect of C-Reactive Protein on the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
PG  - 657
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2018.00657 [doi]
AB  - As a biomarker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) has attracted much
      attention due to its role in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Prospective studies have observed a positive correlation between the level of
      serum CRP and the incidence of T2DM. Recently, studies have reported that drugs
      for curing T2DM can also decrease the level of serum CRP. However, it is not yet 
      clear whether high CRP levels cause T2DM. To evaluate this, we conducted a
      Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genetic variations as instrumental
      variables (IVs). Significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      of CRP were obtained from a genome-wide study and a replication study. Therein,
      17,967 participants were utilized for the genome-wide association study (GWAS),
      and another 14,747 participants were utilized for the replication of identifying 
      SNPs associated with CRP levels. The associations between SNPs and T2DM were from
      the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) consortium. After
      removing SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and T2DM-related SNPs, the four
      remaining CRP-related SNPs were deemed as IVs. To evaluate the pooled influence
      of these IVs on the risk of developing T2DM through CRP, the penalized robust
      inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was carried out. The combined result (OR
      1.114048; 95% CI 1.058656 to 1.172338; P = 0.024) showed that high levels of CRP 
      significantly increase the risk of T2DM. In the subsequent analysis of the
      relationship between CRP and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the pooled result
      (OR 1.017145; 95% CI 0.9066489 to 1.14225; P = 0.909) supported that CRP levels
      cannot determine the risk of developing T1DM.

AB  - Many bacteria produce siderophores to bind and take up Fe(III), an essential
      trace metal with extremely low solubility in oxygenated environments at
      circumneutral pH. The purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris str.
      CGA009 is a metabolically versatile model organism with high iron requirements
      that is able to grow under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Siderophore
      biosynthesis has been predicted by genomic analysis, however, siderophore
      structures were not identified. Here, we elucidate the structure of two novel
      siderophores from R. palustris: rhodopetrobactin A and B. Rhodopetrobactins are
      structural analogues of the known siderophore petrobactin in which the Fe
      chelating moieties are conserved, including two 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and a
      citrate substructure. In the place of two spermidine linker groups in
      petrobactin, rhodopetrobactins contain two 4,4'-diaminodibutylamine groups of
      which one or both are acetylated at the central amine. We analyse siderophore
      production under different growth modes and show that rhodopetrobactins are
      produced in response to Fe limitation under aerobic as well as under anaerobic
      conditions. Evaluation of the chemical characteristics of rhodopetrobactins
      indicates that they are well suited to support Fe acquisition under variable
      oxygen and light conditions.

      systematic review.
PG  - 372-385
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14596 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of aromatherapy and massage on
      relieving stress in nurses. BACKGROUND: Nurses face uncommon levels of stress in 
      medical settings. Stress has a negative impact on nurses' well-being and the
      organisation where they work. Aromatherapy and massage are important strategies
      for stress reduction. However, the effectiveness of aromatherapy and massage on
      relieving stress in nurses currently lacks understanding. DESIGN: Systematic
      review. METHOD: We performed a quantitative systematic review using Cochrane
      methods. We searched existing literature in the following databases: PubMed,
      PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, to examine any
      experimental design studies published from the earliest date available to August 
      2017 in English. Risk of bias per outcome was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 10
      articles met the inclusion criteria, including aromatherapy (n = 4), massage (n =
      4) and aromatherapy massage (n = 2). Most studies reported that aromatherapy and 
      massage exert a beneficial effect on the stress of nurses. One study showed that 
      the aromatherapy massage with music interventions has no effect on the stress of 
      nurses. However, the number of the studies is limited and has high or unclear
      risk of bias. CONCLUSION: This review revealed that the evidence does not
      sufficiently prove that aromatherapy, massage and aromatherapy massage are
      effective for reducing job-related stress of nurses. We need to conduct
      high-quality studies to verify the effects of these interventions on nurses'
      stress levels in the future. Moreover, we need to integrate outcome measures of
      stress levels for developing more appropriate tools than the ones used as
      present. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses' stress has a negative impact on 
      their own and organisation where they work. All available opportunities should be
      taken to reduce nurses' stress. It will be beneficial for nurse shortage.

TI  - Delivery of AMPA receptors to perisynaptic sites precedes the full expression of 
      long-term potentiation.
PG  - 11388-93
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0802978105 [doi]
AB  - Trafficking of AMPA subtype glutamate receptors (AMPARs) from intracellular
      compartments to synapses is thought to be a major mechanism underlying the
      expression of long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular substrate for learning and
      memory. However, it remains unclear whether the AMPAR trafficking that takes
      place during LTP is due to a targeted insertion of AMPARs directly into the
      synapse or delivery to extrasynaptic sites followed by translocation into the
      synapse. Here, we provide direct physiological evidence that LTP induced by a
      theta-burst pairing and tetanic stimulation protocols causes the rapid delivery
      of AMPARs to a perisynaptic site. Perisynaptic AMPARs do not normally detect
      synaptically released glutamate but can do so when the glial glutamate
      transporter EAAT1 is inhibited. AMPARs can be detected at this perisynaptic site 
      before, but not after, the full expression of LTP. The appearance of perisynaptic
      AMPARs requires postsynaptic exocytosis, PKA signaling, and the C-terminal region
      of GluR1 subunit of AMPARs but not actin polymerization. Actin polymerization
      after LTP induction is required to retain AMPARs at the perisynaptic site after
      their appearance. Low-frequency stimulation given shortly after LTP induction
      leads to activity-dependent removal of perisynaptic AMPARs and suppresses the
      subsequent expression of LTP. These results demonstrate that AMPARs are rapidly
      trafficked to perisynaptic sites shortly after LTP induction and suggest that the
      delivery and maintenance of perisynaptic AMPARs may serve as a checkpoint in the 
      expression of LTP.

PG  - 493-502
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1335586 [doi]
AB  - In addition to self reports and questionnaires, biomarkers are of relevance in
      the diagnosis of and therapy for alcohol use disorders. Traditional biomarkers
      such as gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase or mean corpuscular volume are indirect
      biomarkers and are subject to the influence of age, gender and non-alcohol
      related diseases, among others. Direct metabolites of ethanol such as ethyl
      glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS) and phosphatidylethanol (PEth) are direct
      metabolites of ethanol, that are positive after intake of ethyl alcohol. They
      represent useful diagnostic tools for identifying alcohol use even more
      accurately than traditional biomarkers. Each of these drinking indicators remains
      positive in serum and urine for a characteristic time spectrum after the
      cessation of ethanol intake - EtG and EtS in urine up to 7 days, EtG in hair for 
      months after ethanol has left the body. Applications include clinical routine
      use, emergency room settings, proof of abstinence in alcohol rehabilitation
      programmes, driving under influence offenders, workplace testing, assessment of
      alcohol intake in the context of liver transplantation and foetal alcohol
      syndrome. Due to their properties, they open up new perspectives for prevention, 
      interdisciplinary cooperation, diagnosis of and therapy for alcohol-related
      problems.

TI  - Effects of exenatide on measures of beta-cell function after 3 years in
      metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2041-7
LID - 10.2337/dc11-0291 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We previously showed that exenatide (EXE) enhanced insulin secretion
      after 1 year of treatment, relative to insulin glargine (GLAR), with a similar
      glucose-lowering action. These effects were not sustained after a 4-week off-drug
      period. This article reports the results after additional 2 years of exposure.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-nine metformin-treated patients with type 2
      diabetes were randomized to EXE or GLAR. Forty-six patients entered the 2-year
      extension study in which they continued their allocated therapy. Thirty-six
      completed (EXE: n = 16; GLAR: n = 20) the 3-year exposure period. Insulin
      sensitivity (M value) and beta-cell function were measured by euglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic clamp followed by hyperglycemic clamp with arginine stimulation 
      at pretreatment (week 52) and 4 weeks after discontinuation of study medication
      (week 56 and week 172). First-phase glucose stimulated C-peptide secretion was
      adjusted for M value and calculated as the disposition index (DI). RESULTS: At 3 
      years, EXE and GLAR resulted in similar levels of glycemic control: 6.6 +/- 0.2% 
      and 6.9 +/- 0.2%, respectively (P = 0.186). EXE compared with GLAR significantly 
      reduced body weight (-7.9 +/- 1.8 kg; P < 0.001). After the 4-week off-drug
      period, EXE increased the M value by 39% (P = 0.006) while GLAR had no effect (P 
      = 0.647). Following the 4-week off-drug period, the DI, compared with
      pretreatment, increased with EXE, but decreased with GLAR (1.43 +/- 0.78 and
      -0.99 +/- 0.65, respectively; P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: EXE and GLAR sustained
      HbA(1c) over the 3-year treatment period, while EXE reduced body weight and GLAR 
      increased body weight. Following the 3-year treatment with EXE, the DI was
      sustained after a 4-week off-drug period. These findings suggest a beneficial
      effect on beta-cell health.

TI  - Protection of hypoglycemia-induced neuronal death by beta-hydroxybutyrate
      involves the preservation of energy levels and decreased production of reactive
      oxygen species.
PG  - 851-60
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2015.1 [doi]
AB  - Glucose is the main energy substrate in brain but in certain circumstances such
      as prolonged fasting and the suckling period alternative substrates can be used
      such as the ketone bodies (KB), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and acetoacetate. It 
      has been shown that KB prevent neuronal death induced during energy limiting
      conditions and excitotoxicity. The protective effect of KB has been mainly
      attributed to the improvement of mitochondrial function. In the present study, we
      have investigated the protective effect of D-BHB against neuronal death induced
      by severe noncoma hypoglycemia in the rat in vivo and by glucose deprivation (GD)
      in cortical cultures. Results show that systemic administration of D-BHB reduces 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in distinct cortical areas and
      subregions of the hippocampus and efficiently prevents neuronal death in the
      cortex of hypoglycemic animals. In vitro results show that D-BHB stimulates ATP
      production and reduces ROS levels, while the nonphysiologic isomer of BHB, L-BHB,
      has no effect on energy production but reduces ROS levels. Data suggest that
      protection by BHB, not only results from its metabolic action but is also related
      to its capability to reduce ROS, rendering this KB as a suitable candidate for
      the treatment of ischemic and traumatic injury.

TI  - Method for detecting superconducting stripes in high-temperature superconductors 
      based on nonlinear resistivity measurements.
PG  - 127001
AB  - We theoretically study the effect that stripelike superconducting inclusions
      would have on the nonlinear resistivity in single crystals. Even if the stripe
      orientation varies throughout the sample between two orthogonal directions due to
      twinning, we predict that there should be a universal dependence of the nonlinear
      resistivity on the angle between the applied current and the crystal axes. This
      prediction can be used to test the existence of superconducting stripes at and
      above the superconducting transition temperature in cuprate superconductors.

TI  - Marked differences in light-switch behavior of Ru(II) complexes possessing a
      tridentate DNA intercalating ligand.
PG  - 6011-21
AB  - The tridentate ligand 3-(pyrid-2'-yl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine (pydppz)
      has been prepared in two steps by elaboration of
      2-(pyrid-2'-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline. Both homoleptic [Ru(pydppz)(2)](2+) and
      heteroleptic [Ru(tpy)(pydppz)](2+) (tpy = 2,2';6',2' '-terpyridine) complexes
      have been prepared and characterized by (1)H NMR. The absorption and emission
      spectra are consistent with low-lying MLCT excited states, which are typical of
      Ru(II) complexes. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements show that that
      the (3)MLCT excited state of the heteroleptic complex [Ru(tpy)(pydppz)](2+) (tau 
      approximately 5 ns) is longer-lived than that of the homoleptic complex
      [Ru(pydppz)(2)](2+) (tau = 2.4 ns) and that these lifetimes are significantly
      longer than that of the (3)MLCT state of the parent complex [Ru(tpy)(2)](2+) (tau
      = 120 ps). These differences are explained by the lower-energy (3)MLCT excited
      state present in [Ru(tpy)(pydppz)](2+) and [Ru(pydppz)(2)](2+) compared to
      [Ru(tpy)(2)](2+), resulting in less deactivation of the former through the
      ligand-field state(s). DFT and TDDFT calculations are consistent with this
      explanation. [Ru(tpy)(pydppz)](2+) and [Ru(pydppz)(2)](2+) bind to DNA through
      the intercalation of the pydppz ligand; however, only the heteroleptic complex
      exhibits luminescence enhancement in the presence of DNA. The difference in the
      photophysical behavior of the complexes is explained by the inability of
      [Ru(pydppz)(2)](2+) to intercalate both pydppz ligands, such that one pydppz
      always remains exposed to the solvent. DNA photocleavage is observed for
      [Ru(tpy)(pydppz)](2+) in air, but not for [Ru(pydppz)(2)](2+). The DNA damage
      likely proceeds through the production of small amounts of (1)O(2) by the
      longer-lived complex. Although both complexes possess the intercalating pydppz
      ligand, they exhibit different photophysical properties in the presence of DNA.

TI  - No intrinsic gender differences in children's earliest numerical abilities.
PG  - 12

AB  - Recent public discussions have suggested that the under-representation of women
      in science and mathematics careers can be traced back to intrinsic differences in
      aptitude. However, true gender differences are difficult to assess because
      sociocultural influences enter at an early point in childhood. If these claims of
      intrinsic differences are true, then gender differences in quantitative and
      mathematical abilities should emerge early in human development. We examined
      cross-sectional gender differences in mathematical cognition from over 500
      children aged 6 months to 8 years by compiling data from five published studies
      with unpublished data from longitudinal records. We targeted three key milestones
      of numerical development: numerosity perception, culturally trained counting, and
      formal and informal elementary mathematics concepts. In addition to testing for
      statistical differences between boys' and girls' mean performance and
      variability, we also tested for statistical equivalence between boys' and girls' 
      performance. Across all stages of numerical development, analyses consistently
      revealed that boys and girls do not differ in early quantitative and mathematical
      ability. These findings indicate that boys and girls are equally equipped to
      reason about mathematics during early childhood.

PG  - 172-9

AB  - In 1999, Nguyen et al divided focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in 2 groups, the
      classical and nonclassical. The former also included those cases of FNH with
      classical characteristics exhibited "on a subtle scale," whereas the latter
      included among others mainly the telangiectatic FNH (T-FNH) variant.
      Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) was classically considered by definition a neoplasm 
      with no ductal or ductular differentiation, but today the spectrum of HCA does
      include variant 3, which may have CK7+ ductules. Owing to genotypic-phenotypic
      correlation, T-FNH (synonymous with progressive FNH of others) is not considered 
      yet as part of the spectrum of FNH, instead it is diagnosed as a variant of HCA, 
      which now includes 4 variants. Variant-3, which may contain CK7+ ductules, and is
      also termed HCA with ductal/ductular differentiation, corresponds to T-FNH.
      Notwithstanding the nosologic advancement, and outside the "archetypal" types,
      the differential morphologic diagnosis of spontaneous HCA versus FNH may remain
      problematic as ductular proliferation in some cases of FNH may be scanty and hard
      to find. In some histologic overlapping cases of FNH and HCA the morphologic
      diagnosis may be very difficult or even impossible (especially in small lesions) 
      and molecular biology may be of critical assistance. A prototypical case of
      surgically resected multiple spontaneous liver cell adenomas of various types,
      including HCA of T-FNH type and steatotic type, previously interpreted in
      different ways, affecting a young girl, is presented herein.

PG  - 487-490
LID - 10.1080/17474124.2017.1294061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverticular disease (DD) and hepatic and renal cysts have been
      linked with defects in collagen and dysfunctional matrix metalloproteinases.
      METHODS: Consecutive abdominal computed tomography scans between January-July
      2015 were prospectively studied to determine a correlation between visceral cysts
      and DD. Patients with a sigmoid colectomy for pathology other than DD and scans
      in which DD and/or solid organs were not fully visualized were excluded. A
      subgroup analysis was performed on youthful DD patients (<55 years of age, n =
      32) vs. older controls (>55, n = 213). RESULTS: 238 DD patients (50.8% male) and 
      369 controls (40.5% male, p = .02) were included. Incidence of visceral cystic
      disease in DD patients vs. controls was 71.4% vs. 22.5% (p < 0.00001). Renal
      cysts, present in 53.4% of the DD patients and 18.7% of the controls (p <
      .00001), were more common than hepatic cysts in both groups. Hepatic cyst
      prevalence was 8.8 vs. 2.4% (p = .0008). In the subgroup analysis, cystic disease
      was present in 56.2% of youthful DD patients vs. 29.1% of older controls (p =
      .004). CONCLUSIONS: A significant association between cystic disease and DD was
      demonstrated overall and in subgroup analysis inclusive of youthful DD patients
      and older controls. These findings suggest a global defect in connective tissue
      integrity in DD patients.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of high-dose folic acid on endothelial dysfunction in
      pre-eclamptic patients: A randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 114
LID - 10.4103/1735-1995.193505 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia as a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy complicates up 
      to 5-10% of pregnancies worldwide. Endothelial dysfunction plays an important
      role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. In this study, we aim to evaluate the 
      effect of high-dose folic acid on endothelial dysfunction in pre-eclamptic
      patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this triple-blinded randomized clinical
      trial, the enrolled patients were divided randomly into two groups. Folic acid
      5.0 mg or placebo was taken daily by oral administration from the initiation of
      diagnosis until 2 months after delivery by the participants. Every patient's
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was evaluated at the beginning of the study and 2
      months after delivery with the same experienced operator at the same period of
      time (3-5 p.m.) by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography. Potential confounding 
      variables were included in the independent samples t-test. t-test or Mann-Whitney
      U-test was used in the comparison of means between the intervention and placebo
      groups. To compare FMD in each group, before and after the intervention, paired
      t-test was used. RESULTS: Mean value of FMD in intervention (9.64 +/- 5.57) and
      control group (9.30 +/- 4.25) has no significant difference before the
      consumption of drugs (P > 0.05). FMD in intervention group (13.72 +/- 7.89)
      significantly increases after daily consumption of 5 mg folic acid in comparison 
      with control group (10.02 +/- 4.81) after daily consumption of placebo (P =
      0.002). CONCLUSION: Increased mean of FMD in intervention group shows that this
      supplement can improve endothelial function and can be significantly affected by 
      maternal blood pressure during pregnancy and some endothelium-dependent disease
      such as pre-eclampsia and its associated adverse outcomes.

TI  - Combinational soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein
      receptor proteins VAMP8 and Vti1b mediate fusion of antimicrobial and canonical
      autophagosomes with lysosomes.
PG  - 1001-10
LID - 10.1091/mbc.E09-08-0693 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy plays a crucial role in host defense, termed antimicrobial autophagy
      (xenophagy), as it functions to degrade intracellular foreign microbial invaders 
      such as group A Streptococcus (GAS). Xenophagosomes undergo a stepwise maturation
      process consisting of a fusion event with lysosomes, after which the cargoes are 
      degraded. However, the molecular mechanism underlying xenophagosome/lysosome
      fusion remains unclear. We examined the involvement of endocytic soluble
      N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) in
      xenophagosome/lysosome fusion. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that SNAREs, 
      including vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)7, VAMP8, and vesicle
      transport through interaction with t-SNAREs homologue 1B (Vti1b), colocalized
      with green fluorescent protein-LC3 in xenophagosomes. Knockdown of Vti1b and
      VAMP8 with small interfering RNAs disturbed the colocalization of LC3 with
      lysosomal membrane protein (LAMP)1. The invasive efficiency of GAS into cells was
      not altered by knockdown of VAMP8 or Vti1b, whereas cellular bactericidal
      efficiency was significantly diminished, indicating that antimicrobial autophagy 
      was functionally impaired. Knockdown of Vti1b and VAMP8 also disturbed
      colocalization of LC3 with LAMP1 in canonical autophagy, in which LC3-II proteins
      were negligibly degraded. In contrast, knockdown of Syntaxin 7 and Syntaxin 8
      showed little effect on the autophagic fusion event. These findings strongly
      suggest that the combinational SNARE proteins VAMP8 and Vti1b mediate the fusion 
      of antimicrobial and canonical autophagosomes with lysosomes, an essential event 
      for autophagic degradation.

      WI)-performed RF shimming were obtained for each arm position. The mean and
      standard deviation (SD) of the flip angle (FA) at the center of the vertebra on
      each B1(+) map, and contrast noise ratios (CNRs) between the spinal cord and
      cerebrospinal fluid of sagittal T1 WI, were calculated and compared among the
      different arm positions. RESULTS: Mean FA values (degrees) for the arm lift and
      elevated arm positions were significantly larger than for the conventional
      position (P < 0.001 for both) at the twelfth thoracic vertebra (Th12). FA SD
      values for the arm lift and elevated arm position were significantly smaller than
      for the conventional position (P < 0.001 for both) at Th12. CNR for the arm lift 
      and elevated arm position were significantly higher than for the conventional
      position (P = 0.007 and 0.002, respectively). The mean and SD of the FA and the
      CNR did not differ significantly for the arm lift and elevated arm positions (P =
      0.591, 0.958, and 0.927, respectively). CONCLUSION: Inhomogeneities of B1(+) and 
      signal intensities were improved by simply changing the arm position in 3T
      thoracolumbar spinal imaging. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate human plasma circulating levels of adipocyte
      fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) and its relationship with proinflammatory
      adipocytokines and insulin resistance in a severely obese cohort, before and 1
      year after a surgical gastric bypass. Plasmatic levels of A-FABP were measured in
      77 morbid-obese women before and 1 year after bariatric surgery. Anthropometrical
      parameters and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis were
      determined. Circulating levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2
      (sTNFR2), Interleukin 18 (IL-18), adiponectin, and high-sensitive C-reactive
      protein (hsCRP) were also analyzed. Insulin resistance by homeostasis model
      assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was calculated. After massive
      weight loss, A-FABP plasmatic levels decreased significantly [7.6 (8.9) vs. 4.3
      (5.1); P<0,001] but no association with circulating adipokines or proinflammatory
      cytokines, both at the beginning and at the end of follow-up, was observed. A
      decrease in sTNFR2, IL-18, hsCRP, and an increase in adiponectin levels (P<0.001 
      in all cases) were observed after the gastric bypass. HOMA-IR index improved 1
      year after surgery and after multiple regression analysis remained associated
      with A-FABP after controlling for confounding variables (beta=0.322, P=0.014; R2 
      for the model 0.281). In morbid-obese women, plasma A-FABP concentrations were
      dramatically reduced after gastric bypass surgery. After weight loss this protein
      contributed to HOMA-IR index independently of proinflammatory/antinflammatory
      cytokine profile. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of A-FABP
      in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in morbid obesity.

TI  - Pathway cross-talk network strategy reveals key pathways in non-small cell lung
      cancer.
PG  - 1252-1258
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the pathway cross-talks and key
      pathways in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to better understand the
      underlying pathological mechanism. METHODS: Integrated gene expression data,
      pathway data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data were assessed to identify
      the pathway regulatory interactions in NSCLC, and constructed the background and 
      disease pathway crosstalk networks, respectively. In this work, the attractor
      method was implemented to identified the differential pathways, and the rank
      product (RP) algorithm was used to determine the importance of pathways. RESULTS:
      Based on 787,896 PPI interactions from STRING database and 300 human pathways
      from KEGG, we constructed the back pathway cross-talk network with 300 nodes and 
      42239 edges. Integrating with expression data of NSCLC, each pathway cross-talk
      endowed with a weight value, and disease pathway cross-talks were identified. By 
      RP algorithm and topology analysis of network, we selected 5 key pathways,
      including Alanine, DNA replication, Fanconi anemia pathway, Cell cycle and
      MicroRNAs in cancer under the pre-set thresholds. CONCLUSION: We successfully
      revealed the disease pathway cross-talks and explored 5 key pathways in NSCLC,
      which may be the underlying therapeutic targets for lung cancer.

TI  - Quantitation of a Therapeutic Antibody in Serum Using Intact Sequential Affinity 
      Capture, Trypsin Digestion, and LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 866-871
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03716 [doi]
AB  - Large molecule quantitation by LC-MS/MS commonly relies on bottom-up or so-called
      surrogate peptide measurements to infer the whole-molecule concentration. This
      can lead to questions about what is actually being measured in the assay (intact 
      drug and/or other drug related material). An intact sequential affinity capture
      (ISAC) assay was developed utilizing two different immunoaffinity (IA) reagents. 
      The reagents were selective for the heavy and light chain of a monoclonal
      antibody, which when used consecutively, ensures that only the intact form of the
      antibody is represented by the surrogate peptide. The approach provided
      comparable results to a traditional sandwich IA assay indicating similar capture 
      populations. The use of an initial ISAC assessment of affinity capture
      purification, should add a degree of confidence in the use of a single
      IA-LC-MS/MS quantitation assay.

      Congenital Anomalies.
PG  - 1462818
LID - 10.1155/2016/1462818 [doi]
AB  - Congenital anomalies affect 1% to 2% of the newborns. The urinary tract and the
      kidneys are involved in 4-5% of the cases while upper-extremities abnormalities
      are present in 10%. Certain anomalies occur in isolation, whereas others are
      associated with systemic conditions. The prenatal detection of fetal anomalies
      compatible with life is a challenge for both the parents and the physician. The
      prognosis for the fetus/newborn and the reproductive decisions of the family
      largely depend on the causes underlying the disease. The reported case is of a
      G2P1 pregnant woman referred for routine ultrasound scan at 24 weeks of gestation
      (w.g.). The fetus had growth retardation, right kidney agenesis, bilateral
      absence of radial bones and thumbs, radial deviation of the wrists, and short
      humeri. Nuchal fold thickness was 5 mm and there was a single umbilical artery.
      After termination of pregnancy, SNP array genotyping and next-generation
      sequencing of targeted candidate-genes were performed trying to clarify the
      etiology of the fetal polymalformative syndrome. A new hypomorphic mutation in
      FANCD2 gene was found to underlie this fetal anomaly. The case illustrates that
      patients/families affected by rare monogenic disorders may benefit from
      application of modern technologies like microarrays and NGS.

      Controversial 2(1)Ag State of trans-Butadiene?
PG  - 13770-13778
LID - 10.1021/jacs.7b06283 [doi]
AB  - Butadiene is the simplest polyene and has long served as a model system for many 
      chemical and spectroscopic properties. However, this small molecule has presented
      significant challenges to theoretical chemistry. The 2(1)Ag state, which is dark 
      but photochemically important, is a prime source of this difficulty. Previous
      studies attributed the notorious difficulty in treating this state to strong
      double excitation character of the 2(1)Ag state, which prevents the application
      of linear response (LR) methods. Therefore, one would require methods with much
      higher computational cost, especially for the analogues of this state in longer
      polyenes, and consequently studies of longer polyenes are very limited. In the
      present work, we argue that the difficulty stems more significantly from the
      inherently multiconfigurational character of the ground state. In addition, we
      validate the possibility of employing LR time-dependent density functional theory
      to investigate such a state with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - Three-color confocal Forster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer
      microscopy: Quantitative analysis of protein interactions in the nucleation of
      actin filaments in live cells.
PG  - 580-8
LID - 10.1002/cyto.a.22651 [doi]
AB  - Experiments using live cell 3-color Forster (or fluorescence) resonance energy
      transfer (FRET) microscopy and corresponding in vitro biochemical reconstitution 
      of the same proteins were conducted to evaluate actin filament nucleation. A
      novel application of 3-color FRET data is demonstrated, extending the analysis
      beyond the customary energy-transfer efficiency (E%) calculations. MDCK cells
      were transfected for coexpression of Teal-N-WASP/Venus-IQGAP1/mRFP1-Rac1,
      Teal-N-WASP/Venus-IQGAP1/mRFP1-Cdc42, CFP-Rac1/Venus-IQGAP1/mCherry-actin, or
      CFP-Cdc42/Venus-IQGAP1/mCherry-actin, and with single-label equivalents for
      spectral bleedthrough correction. Using confirmed E% as an entry point,
      fluorescence levels and related ratios were correlated at discrete accumulating
      levels at cell peripheries. Rising ratios of CFP-Rac1:Venus-IQGAP1 were
      correlated with lower overall actin fluorescence, whereas the
      CFP-Cdc42:Venus-IQGAP1 ratio correlated with increased actin fluorescence at low 
      ratios, but was neutral at higher ratios. The new FRET analyses also indicated
      that rising levels of mRFP1-Cdc42 or mRFP1-Rac1, respectively, promoted or
      suppressed the association of Teal-N-WASP with Venus-IQGAP1. These 3-color FRET
      assays further support our in vitro results about the role of IQGAP1, Rac1, and
      Cdc42 in actin nucleation, and the differential impact of Rac1 and Cdc42 on the
      association of N-WASP with IQGAP1. In addition, this study emphasizes the power
      of 3-color FRET as a systems biology strategy for simultaneous evaluation of
      multiple interacting proteins in individual live cells.

AB  - Major trauma, shock, sepsis, and other conditions can lead to the acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may progress to the highly lethal
      multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Although a number of therapeutic
      strategies have been initiated, their success has been limited largely due to an 
      incomplete understanding of the biology of MODS. However, recent studies indicate
      that the intestinal lymphatics serve as the primary route for nonbacterial,
      tissue injurious gut-derived factors, which can induce acute ARDS and MODS. The
      gut lymph hypothesis of ARDS and MODS thus helps clarify several important
      issues. First, because the lung is the first organ exposed to mesenteric lymph
      and not the liver (i.e., mesenteric lymph enters the subclavian vein via the
      thoracic duct, which, in turn, empties directly into the heart and lungs), it
      would explain the clinical observation that the lung is generally the first organ
      to fail. Second, this hypothesis provides new pathophysiologic information,
      thereby providing a basis for novel therapies. Finally, by studying the
      composition of lymph, MODS-inducing factors can be isolated and identified.

TI  - Implementation of Symptom Protocols for Nurses Providing Telephone-Based Cancer
      Symptom Management: A Comparative Case Study.
PG  - 420-431
LID - 10.1111/wvn.12166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pan-Canadian Oncology Symptom Triage and Remote Support (COSTaRS)
      team developed 13 evidence-informed protocols for symptom management. AIM: To
      build an effective and sustainable approach for implementing the COSTaRS
      protocols for nurses providing telephone-based symptom support to cancer
      patients. METHODS: A comparative case study was guided by the Knowledge to Action
      Framework. Three cases were created for three Canadian oncology programs that
      have nurses providing telephone support. Teams of researchers and knowledge
      users: (a) assessed barriers and facilitators influencing protocol use, (b)
      adapted protocols for local use, (c) intervened to address barriers, (d)
      monitored use, and (e) assessed barriers and facilitators influencing sustained
      use. Analysis was within and across cases. RESULTS: At baseline, >85% nurses
      rated protocols positively but barriers were identified (64-80% needed training).
      Patients and families identified similar barriers and thought protocols would
      enhance consistency among nurses teaching self-management. Twenty-two COSTaRS
      workshops reached 85% to 97% of targeted nurses (N = 119). Nurses felt more
      confident with symptom management and using the COSTaRS protocols (p < .01).
      Protocol adaptations addressed barriers (e.g., health records approval, creating 
      pocket versions, distributing with telephone messages). Chart audits revealed
      that protocols used were documented for 11% to 47% of patient calls. Sustained
      use requires organizational alignment and ongoing leadership support. LINKING
      EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Protocol uptake was similar to trials that have evaluated
      tailored interventions to improve professional practice by overcoming identified 
      barriers. Collaborating with knowledge users facilitated interpretation of
      findings, aided protocol adaptation, and supported implementation. Protocol
      implementation in nursing requires a tailored approach. A multifaceted
      intervention approach increased nurses' use of evidence-informed protocols during
      telephone calls with patients about symptoms. Training and other interventions
      improved nurses' confidence with using COSTaRS protocols and their uptake was
      evident in some documented telephone calls. Protocols could be adapted for use by
      patients and nurses globally.

AB  - Human amyloid beta peptides Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 exhibit NADH oxidase activity
      with regular oscillations at intervals of ca 6 min. In the presence of copper,
      the oscillations in Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 become more pronounced and now assume
      a period length of 24 min. In the presence of copper, the oscillations are
      similar to those observed with NADH oxidase activities of cell surface ECTO-NOX
      proteins in general including a period length of 24 min. Solutions of copper
      sulphate in the presence of all the reagents except for the peptides did not
      exhibit the oscillatory behavior. NOX proteins have been reported previously to
      have properties of prions and to form amyloid rods of indeterminant length
      similar to those formed by the 39-43 residue amyloid beta proteins (Abeta). In
      this report, we demonstrate a second similarity between ECTO-NOX proteins and
      amyloid beta, that of an oscillating NADH oxidase activity with a period length
      of 24 min when assayed in the presence of copper.

TI  - Prediction of significant vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage using
      automated data.
PG  - 444-50
LID - 10.1007/s12028-014-9976-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: When vasospasm is detected after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
      (aSAH), it is treated with hypertensive or endovascular therapy. Current
      classification methods are resource-intensive, relying on specialty-trained
      professionals (nursing exams, transcranial dopplers, and perfusion imaging). More
      passively obtained variables such as cerebrospinal fluid drainage volumes,
      sodium, glucose, blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and heart rate, have not 
      been used to predict vasospasm. We hypothesize that these features may yield as
      much information as resource-intensive features to classify vasospasm. METHODS:
      We studied data from 81 aSAH patients presenting within two days of onset.
      Vasospasm class (VSP) was defined by angiographic vasospasm warranting
      endovascular treatment. Naive Bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR) classifiers
      were trained on selected variable feature sets from the first three days of
      illness. Performance of trained classifiers was evaluated using area under the
      receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC classifier) and F-measure (F
      classifier). Ablation analysis determined incremental utility of each variable
      and subsets. RESULTS: 43.2 % developed VSP. During feature selection, the only
      passively collected variable that did not yield a statistically significant
      summary statistic was CSF drainage volume. NB classifier trained on all passively
      obtained features (AUC NB 0.708 and F NB 0.636) outperformed NB classifier
      trained on resource-intensive features (AUC NB 0.501 and F NB 0.349).
      CONCLUSIONS: Data-driven analysis of passively obtained clinical data predicted
      VSP better than current targeted resource-intensive monitoring techniques after
      aSAH. Automated classification of VSP may be possible.

      to assess the extent of the clinical problem and to initiate discussion on
      prolonged chemoprophylaxis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent
      surgery for proximal hip fractures in one year (2001-2002) were followed up.
      Patient case-notes were used to identify all morbidity episodes within 3 months
      following discharge. Patients with suspected symptomatic thromboembolic episodes 
      were investigated to confirm the diagnoses objectively. Reasons for hospital
      readmission and causes of death were identified. RESULTS: A total of 267 patients
      who underwent surgery for proximal hip fractures were included in the study.
      Forty-three patients died during initial admission episode. Of the 224 patients
      discharged, 46 (20.54%) patients were referred back to hospital within 3 months, 
      for unplanned emergency management. Of these, 8 patients (3.57%) were referred
      back for suspected thromboembolic events. Of these, 6 (2.67%) were referred with 
      a clinical diagnoses of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but only 1 patient (0.45%) was
      confirmed to have DVT. Two patients (0.89%) were referred with features of
      pulmonary embolism (PE). Both were confirmed on ventilation-perfusion scans and
      both patients died. One patient died following PE in the community.Thus, overall,
      3 deaths (1.34%) following discharge were recorded to be due to pulmonary
      embolism. CONCLUSIONS: Suspected thromboembolic events constitute a major
      proportion of unplanned referrals back to the hospital. Three deaths due to
      delayed pulmonary embolism may justify prolonged universal chemoprophylaxis
      following hip fracture surgery.

AB  - The efficacy of infliximab is influenced by individual variability in its
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Serum infliximab concentrations could
      therefore be related to the efficacy and tolerance of infliximab, and assist
      adjustment of treatment. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the
      value of measuring serum infliximab concentrations in psoriatic patients. A
      bibliographic search was performed on MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS for
      original studies on serum infliximab concentrations in psoriatic patients treated
      with infliximab. Ten articles were included, representing evaluation of serum
      infliximab concentrations in 733 patients. Predictive value of higher serum
      infliximab concentrations on long-term response maintenance was suggested in 3
      studies. There was no information regarding the value of such measurements for
      adjustment of infliximab dosage. Trough serum infliximab concentrations that are 
      at least detectable (>0.1 mg/L) at steady state (week 22) seem to be associated
      with maintaining a clinical response in the long term.

AB  - Firstly, functional macromolecule polyethyleneimine (PEI) was grafted onto the
      surfaces of silica gel particles via the coupling grafting method, the adsorption
      material PEI/SiO(2) was formed. Secondly, the molecular imprinting was carried
      out towards the macromolecule PEI grafted on the surface of silica particles
      using phenol as a template and diepoxyalkyl (669) as a crosslinking agent.
      Finally, imprinted polymer MIP-PEI/SiO(2) with high affinity, specific
      recognition ability and excellent selectivity for phenol was prepared. The
      adsorption and recognition ability of MIP-PEI/SiO(2) for phenol were researched
      by static methods. The experimental results show that MIP-PEI/SiO(2) possesses
      very strong adsorption and recognition ability for phenol. The saturated
      adsorption capacity could reach to 46.6 mg g(-1). The selectivity coefficients
      relative to resorcin and p-nitrophenol are 35.41 and 37.40, respectively. The
      empirical Freundlich isotherm was found to describe well the equilibrium
      adsorption data. pH and temperature have great influence on the adsorption
      capacity. Diluted hydrochloric acid solution is used as eluent, and the adsorbed 
      phenol is eluted easily from MIP-PEI/SiO(2).

      effective diagnostic workup in cervical metastasis of carcinoma from an unknown
      primary tumor.
PG  - 685-93

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of
      (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((1)(8)FDG) positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) imaging for the diagnosis of cervical metastasis of carcinoma
      of an unknown primary tumor (CUP) and to determine whether the maximum
      standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) is a prognostic factor. METHODS: Twenty-five
      consecutive patients with cervical metastasis of CUP were retrospectively
      analyzed by PET/CT between July 2007 and July 2011. RESULTS: FDG PET/CT suggested
      a primary tumor in 21 out of 25 patients (84.0%). The sensitivity of FDG PET/CT
      in detecting the primary tumor was 73.3% (11 of 15), and the positive predictive 
      value was 52.4% (11 of 21). The median follow-up duration of survival patients
      was 10.4 months (range: 0-30 months). The estimated 2-year overall survival rate 
      of all patients was 50.0%. Univariate analyses did not reveal a significant
      difference in overall survival between the group of 11 patients identified by
      pathology and the 14 patients not identified by pathology (overall survival was
      57.1% and 49.1%, respectively; p=0.468). The median SUV(max) was 7.6. In the
      log-rank test, patients with a low SUV(max) (</= 7.0) in cervical lymph nodes had
      a significantly higher survival rate at 2 years (87.5% vs. 21.2%; p=0.007) than
      patients with a high SUV(max) (>7.0). CONCLUSIONS: Although our study was
      inconclusive due to the small sample size, our results suggest that FDG PET/CT
      may be an effective diagnostic workup in the cervical metastasis of carcinoma
      from an unknown primary tumor (UPT). In the present study, SUV(max) of PET/CT in 
      the cervical lymph node may serve as a prognostic factor of cervical metastasis
      of carcinoma from a UPT based on the limited number of patients. Further studies 
      are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - The study was aimed to investigate the association between the degree of
      oligozoospermia and sperm chromosome aneuploidy frequencies in male infertility
      and to determine whether chromosomal profiles of sperm nuclei would be used for a
      supportive test before additive reproduction technics. The meiotic segregation
      profiles of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18 and 21 were compared by fluorescent in-situ 
      hybridisation (FISH) on the spermatozoa of 30 normally karyotyped oligozoospermic
      (10 mild, 11 moderate, nine severe) cases without Y-microdeletions, and 10
      normozoospermic cases. The results showed significantly higher frequencies of
      chromosomes 13, 18, 21 disomies (P < 0.001) in the group of patients with
      moderate and severe oligozoospermia compared with the disomy frequencies of
      normozoospermic group. The statistically significant differences were also
      determined in disomy frequencies of sex chromosomes (XY, XX and YY) in between
      oligozoospermic and normozoospermic groups (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.040,
      respectively). Because oligozoospermic patients are the ones consulted the most
      for assisted reproductive techniques, identification of sperm aneuploidy rates in
      men could be considered as an appropriate supportive test before the reproductive
      implementations. Furthermore, the patients should be counselled with respect to
      genetic screening results for the potential risk of aneuploid embryo and
      pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - Effects of face contour and features on early occipitotemporal activity when
      viewing eye movement.
PG  - 1624-35
AB  - We investigated whether early activity in the occipitotemporal region,
      corresponding to human MT/V5, is influenced by a face contour and/or features
      such as the mouth using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We used apparent motion as 
      visual stimuli and compared four conditions as follows: (1) CDL: A schematic face
      consisting of a face Contour, two Dots and a horizontal Line (2) CD: The Contour 
      and two Dots (3) DL: Two Dots and a horizontal Line and (4) D: Two Dots only.
      Subjects described a simple movement of dots for D, but eye movement for CDL, DL 
      and CD, though movement modalities were the same through all conditions. We used 
      a single equivalent current dipole (ECD) model within 145-220 ms after stimulus
      onset and estimated the location, dipole moment (strength) and peak latency.
      There were no significant differences in the peak latency of the estimated
      dipoles between each condition, but the activity was significantly stronger for
      CDL than for CD (p<0.05), DL (p<0.01), and D (p<0.01) in the right hemisphere,
      and DL and D (p<0.01) in the left. These results indicated that there is specific
      information processing for eye movements in the occipitotemporal region, the
      human MT/V5 homologue, and this activity was significantly influenced by whether 
      movements appeared with the face contour and/or features, in other words, whether
      the eyes moved or not, even if the movement itself was the same.

      brain including the brainstem. In 2013, the Brain Injury Evaluation Quality
      Control Centre (BQCC) of the National Health and Family Planning Commission
      issued criteria and practical guidelines for the determination of brain death.
      This study aimed to evaluate whether the institutions have adopted these
      guidelines and to make suggestions for the improvement of the current criteria
      and practical guidelines for brain death determination in China. Methods:
      Consecutive brain death cases from 44 hospitals were evaluated for summary
      statistics for the following data: the performance of BQCC criteria and practical
      guidelines, clinical examination, apnea testing, ancillary testing, and the
      number of examinations as well as the waiting periods between examinations and
      details of who determined brain death. Data analysis was conducted from January
      2013 to December 2017. Results: A total of 550 cases were obtained. All patients 
      were determined to have deep coma and met the prerequisites for clinical testing.
      The performance rates of four brainstem reflex examinations (except cough reflex)
      ranged from 97.5% to 98.0%, and the completion rate as well as the coincidence
      rate were both 100.0%. The 238 cases (50.7%) completed apnea testing, and 231
      cases (42.0%) had to stop apnea testing during the examination because of
      instability. The performance rates of the three ancillary tests, including
      electroencephalogram, short-latency somatosensory evoked potential, and
      transcranial Doppler, were 89.5%, 67.5%, and 79.5%, respectively; furthermore,
      the coincidence rates were 98.6%, 96.5%, and 99.5%, respectively. The combination
      of two ancillary tests was more accurate than one single ancillary test. A total 
      of 401 (72.9%) cases successfully underwent two separate examinations to
      determine brain death with at least a 12-h waiting period. All brain death cases 
      were determined by at least two qualified physicians. Conclusion: This study
      might provide suggestions for brain death determination in China.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of exogenous L-arginine and
      HDL on LDL and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL)-mediated platelet activation. Adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP)-activated platelets have been incubated with lipoproteins with 
      or without L-arginine. P-selectin receptor numbers per platelet have been
      measured by flow cytometry. After incubation with only L-arginine (without
      lipoproteins), platelet nitric oxide (NO) levels and P-selectin receptor numbers 
      significantly increased compared to the controls (P < .05). After incubation with
      LDL or ox-LDL, receptor numbers of P-selectin significantly increased (P < .001).
      However, P-selectin receptor numbers in platelets treated with L-arginine + LDL
      or L-arginine + ox-LDL decreased compared to the levels in platelets treated with
      only LDL or ox-LDL (P < .01, P < .001, respectively). Addition of HDL to
      L-arginine + ox-LDL caused significant reduction in P-selectin receptor numbers
      as in the control values (P < .001).We have concluded that L-arginine causes
      enhanced platelet NO levels and blocks the effects of LDL or ox-LDL on platelet
      P-selectin receptor numbers and HDL also strengthens this effect of L-arginine.

PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1016/j.csm.2008.08.009 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle injuries are extremely common, accounting for up to 35%-55% of
      all sports injuries and quite possibly affecting all musculoskeletal traumas.
      These injuries result in the formation of fibrosis, which may lead to the
      development of painful contractures, increases patients' risk for repeat
      injuries, and limits their ability to return to a baseline or pre-injury level of
      function. The development of successful therapies for these injuries must
      consider the pathophysiology of these musculoskeletal conditions. We discuss the 
      direct use of muscle-derived stem cells and some key cell population dynamics as 
      well as the use of clinically applicable modalities that may enhance the local
      supply of stem cells to the zone of injury by promoting angiogenesis.

TI  - Correlation between musculoskeletal function and radiological joint scores in
      haemophilia A adolescents.
PG  - 920-5

AB  - The functional independence score in haemophilia (FISH) is a performance-based
      instrument used to assess musculoskeletal function in patients with haemophilia. 
      We aimed to evaluate the functional independence of haemophilia A adolescents and
      its correlation to radiological joint scores. A cross-sectional study was carried
      out on 50 adolescent haemophilia A patients. Musculoskeletal function was
      assessed using the FISH and individual joints were assessed radiologically using 
      the Pettersson score and MRI scale. The mean age of our patients was 16 +/- 1.1
      with a mean FISH of 23.32 +/- 4.69 (range 13-28) and a mean Pettersson score of
      2.32 +/- 3.09 (range 0-13) for the knees, 1.86 +/- 2.67 (range 0-11) for ankles
      and 1.42 +/- 2.17 (range 0-10) for elbows. The mean MRI score for the knees was
      3.92 +/- 2.74 (range 0-10) while that for ankles was 3.16 +/- 2.64 (range 0-10)
      and for elbows was 2.34 +/- 2.63 (range 0-10). There was highly significant
      correlation between both radiological joint scores and FISH and between degree of
      factor VIII deficiency and each of FISH, Pettersson score and MRI score. MRI was 
      superior to conventional radiography in detection of subchondral cyst formation
      and erosions at joint margins. Given the highly significant correlation with both
      radiological joint scores, FISH appears to be a reliable tool for assessment of
      functional independence in adolescents with haemophilia A. MRI is more sensitive 
      than conventional radiography in detection of early joint abnormalities.

TI  - Hemiepiphysiodesis for the correction of angular deformity about the knee.
PG  - 188-91
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181653ade [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that the presence of angular deformity about
      the knee that persists into the preadolescent years will not correct
      spontaneously. The goal of this study was to review our experience with
      hemiepiphysiodesis and physeal stapling for the correction of angular deformity
      to establish the efficacy of these procedures and to determine their indications 
      and the rate of correction. METHODS: A retrospective review of 48 patients
      undergoing hemiepiphysiodesis or physeal stapling about the knee was performed.
      Patients were included if they had at least 2 years of documented follow-up
      without an osteotomy. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 30.4 months (range,
      24-52 months). Genu varum was identified in 33 patients, genu valgum in 14
      patients, and a windswept deformity in 1. Of the 52 limbs with genu varum, 35
      were secondary to Blount disease. The group with genu varum unrelated to Blount
      disease presented a change in the mechanical axis from a mean of -32 degrees at
      surgery to a mean of - 13 degrees. The patients with Blount disease presented a
      change in the mechanical axis from a mean of -19 degrees at surgery to a mean of 
      -16 degrees. The group with genu valgum presented a change in the mechanical axis
      from a mean of 20 degrees at surgery to a mean of 2 degrees. CONCLUSIONS:
      Hemiepiphysiodesis is an effective means for correcting angular deformity about
      the knee in skeletally immature patients with both genu valgum and genu varum, so
      long as the genu varum is unrelated to Blount disease. Hemiepiphysiodesis is
      effective in preventing the progression of deformity in patients with Blount
      disease. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic-Level IV.

TI  - [Night work and shift work - effects on the health of workers].
PG  - 513-5
AB  - Number of shift workers increases in developed as well as in developing countries
      every year and equals 15- 20% of total amount of working people in Europe, 20% of
      total count of workers in United States of America, 6-32% in Asian countries and 
      8.1% workers in Poland. This type of employment is connected with such sectors of
      economy as medical care, industry, mining, transportation, communication and
      hospitality. The literature review analyses health effects of shift work and
      night work in the area of gastroenterology, circulatory system, oncologic
      diseases, neuropsychiatric and sleep disorders. In summary shift and night work
      have negative impact on human health. Further investigations analyzing impact of 
      shift and night work are needed.

      acid oxidation to fuel non-shivering thermogenesis. In mice, mutations in the
      acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family of fatty acid oxidation genes are associated with
      sensitivity to cold. Brown adipose tissue function has not previously been
      characterized in these knockout strains. Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
      (SCAD) deficient mice were found to have increased brown adipose tissue mass as
      well as modest cardiac hypertrophy. Uncoupling protein-1 was reduced by 70% in
      brown adipose tissue and this was not due to a change in mitochondrial number,
      nor was it due to decreased signal transduction through protein kinase A which is
      known to be a major regulator of uncoupling protein-1 expression. PKA activity
      and in vitro lipolysis were normal in brown adipose tissue, although in white
      adipose tissue a modest increase in basal lipolysis was seen in SCAD-/- mice.
      Finally, an in vivo norepinephrine challenge of brown adipose tissue
      thermogenesis revealed normal heat production in SCAD-/- mice. These results
      suggest that reduced brown adipose tissue function is not the major factor
      causing cold sensitivity in acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout strains. We speculate
      that other mechanisms such as shivering capacity, cardiac function, and reduced
      hepatic glycogen stores are involved.

LID - Article 36 [pii]
AB  - This commentary takes up Pearl's welcome challenge to clearly articulate the
      scientific value of principal stratification estimands that we and colleagues
      have investigated, in the area of randomized placebo-controlled preventive
      vaccine efficacy trials, especially trials of HIV vaccines. After briefly arguing
      that certain principal stratification estimands for studying vaccine effects on
      post-infection outcomes are of genuine scientific interest, the bulk of our
      commentary argues that the "causal effect predictiveness" (CEP) principal
      stratification estimand for evaluating immune biomarkers as surrogate endpoints
      is not of ultimate scientific interest, because it evaluates surrogacy restricted
      to the setting of a particular vaccine efficacy trial, but is nevertheless useful
      for guiding the selection of primary immune biomarker endpoints in Phase I/II
      vaccine trials and for facilitating assessment of transportability/bridging
      surrogacy.

      reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).
PG  - 2068-74
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.01.059 [doi]
AB  - Currently, killed-virus and modified-live PRRSV vaccines are used to control
      porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome disease (PRRS). However, very
      limited efficacy of killed-virus vaccines and serious safety concerns for
      modified-live virus vaccines demand the development of novel PRRSV vaccines. In
      this report, we investigated the possibility of using transgenic plants as a
      cost-effective and scalable system for production and delivery of a viral protein
      as an oral subunit vaccine against PRRSV. Corn calli were genetically engineered 
      to produce PRRSV viral envelope-associated M protein. Both serum and intestine
      mucosal antigen-specific antibodies were induced by oral administration of the
      transgenic plant tissues to mice. In addition, serum and mucosal antibodies
      showed virus neutralization activity. The neutralization antibody titers after
      the final boost reached 6.7 in serum and 3.7 in fecal extracts, respectively. A
      PRRSV-specific IFN-gamma response was also detected in splenocytes of vaccinated 
      animals. These results demonstrate that transgenic corn plants are an efficient
      subunit vaccine production and oral delivery system for generation of both
      systemic and mucosal immune responses against PRRSV.

TI  - UPA promotes lipid-loaded vascular smooth muscle cell migration through LRP-1.
PG  - 262-71
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvt171 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a crucial event in
      atherosclerosis and vascular repair. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) infiltrated in
      the vessel wall become aggregated (agLDL) and internalized by VSMC through the
      LDL receptor-related protein LRP1, deriving in lipid-loaded cells with reduced
      motility capacity. The urokinase-plasminogen activator (UPA)/UPA receptor (UPAR) 
      system plays a relevant role in vascular remodelling. Here, we investigated
      whether UPA-ligand binding is involved in the detrimental effects of lipid
      loading in VSMC migration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Animals fed a high-fat diet had
      10-fold higher cholesterol-LDL plasma levels, >60% decrease in aortic UPA-protein
      expression, and VSMC showed impaired outgrowth from aortic explants. Angiotensin 
      II infusion significantly increased aortic UPA expression and accelerated VSMC
      migration. Using an in vitro model of wound repair, we showed that agLDL inhibits
      UPA-mediated VSMC migration. UPA silencing reduced migration in control cells to 
      levels observed in lipid-loaded VSMC. UPA silencing did not affect migration in
      lipid-loaded VSMC. UPA expression was significantly decreased in agLDL-exposed
      VSMC. agLDL also induced changes in the subcellular localization of UPA, with a
      reduction in colocalization with UPAR strongly evident at the front edge of
      agLDL-treated migrating cells. Rescue experiments showed that UPA acting as UPAR 
      ligand restored migration capacity of agLDL-VSMC to control levels. The effects
      of UPA/UPAR on migration of lipid-loaded cells occurred through the binding to
      LRP-1. CONCLUSION: UPA-ligand binding regulates VSMC migration, a process that is
      interfered by LDL. Thus, tissue infiltrated LDL through the abrogation of UPA
      function reduces VSMC-regulated vascular repair.

TI  - Neuronal responses in visual area V2 (V2) of macaque monkeys with strabismic
      amblyopia.
PG  - 2033-45
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhq272 [doi]
AB  - Amblyopia, a developmental disorder of spatial vision, is thought to result from 
      a cascade of cortical deficits over several processing stages beginning at the
      primary visual cortex (V1). However, beyond V1, little is known about how
      cortical development limits the visual performance of amblyopic primates. We
      quantitatively analyzed the monocular and binocular responses of V1 and V2
      neurons in a group of strabismic monkeys exhibiting varying depths of amblyopia. 
      Unlike in V1, the relative effectiveness of the affected eye to drive V2 neurons 
      was drastically reduced in the amblyopic monkeys. The spatial resolution and the 
      orientation bias of V2, but not V1, neurons were subnormal for the affected eyes.
      Binocular suppression was robust in both cortical areas, and the magnitude of
      suppression in individual monkeys was correlated with the depth of their
      amblyopia. These results suggest that the reduced functional connections beyond
      V1 and the subnormal spatial filter properties of V2 neurons might have
      substantially limited the sensitivity of the amblyopic eyes and that interocular 
      suppression was likely to have played a key role in the observed alterations of
      V2 responses and the emergence of amblyopia.

      novel [0,0,0]-rhodacynines, 3e and 3h, possessing a benzothiazole moiety, were
      shown to have highly promising antimalarial activities in vivo. Moreover, the
      [0,0,0]-rhodacyanines were found to be orally bioavailable.

TI  - Carbohydrate restriction (with or without additional dietary cholesterol provided
      by eggs) reduces insulin resistance and plasma leptin without modifying appetite 
      hormones in adult men.
PG  - 262-8
LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2009.03.007 [doi]
AB  - Carbohydrate-restricted diets (CRDs) have been shown to reduce body weight,
      whereas whole egg intake has been associated with increased satiety. The purpose 
      of this study was to evaluate the effects of additional dietary cholesterol and
      protein provided by whole eggs while following a CRD on insulin resistance and
      appetite hormones. Using a randomized blind parallel design, subjects were
      allocated to an egg (640 mg/d additional dietary cholesterol) or placebo (0 mg/d 
      additional dietary cholesterol) group for 12 weeks while following a CRD. There
      were significant reductions in fasting insulin (P < .025) and fasting leptin
      concentrations (P < .01) for both groups, which were correlated with the
      reductions in body weight and body fat (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Both 
      groups reduced insulin resistance as measured by the homeostatic model assessment
      of insulin resistance (P < .025). There was a significant decrease in serum
      glucose levels observed after the intervention. We did not observe the expected
      increases in plasma ghrelin levels associated with weight loss, suggesting a
      mechanism by which subjects do not increase appetite with CRD. To confirm these
      results, the subjective measures of satiety using visual analog scale showed that
      both groups felt more "full" (P < .05), "satisfied" (P < .001), and "wanted to
      eat less" (P < .001) after the intervention. These results indicate that
      inclusion of eggs in the diet (additional dietary cholesterol) did not modify the
      multiple beneficial effects of CRD on insulin resistance and appetite hormones.

AB  - Dynamics, or how stimulation occurs over time, influences the somatosensory
      impact of volatile chemicals. Within an experimental session, sensation waxes
      with steady presentation over seconds to minutes, may reach a plateau, and then
      may fade. Long-term occupational exposure can desensitize the trigeminal system. 
      Short- and long-term dynamics might be mediated by different mechanisms. For
      brief intranasal exposures (i.e., up to about 10 seconds), studies have
      systematically manipulated both time (duration of exposure) and concentration to 
      maintain a fixed perceived intensity or a fixed level of detection. A simple mass
      integration model describes the trade-off between concentration and time quite
      well: a fixed-ratio increase in duration compensates for a fixed-ratio decrease
      in concentration. However, for most compounds, more than a two-fold increase in
      duration are required to compensate for cutting concentration in half. For
      example, for ethanol, an increase in duration of about six-fold are required. For
      such compounds that display highly imperfect integration, a fixed number of
      molecules might have a much greater sensory impact when presented over 0.2
      seconds than over 0.5 seconds. Nasal chemesthesis may be temporally sluggish
      compared to olfaction, but fine-grained dynamics still matter. Time-intensity
      ratings of nasal irritation from dynamic stimuli also support this conclusion.
      Although integration is generally imperfect, compounds vary widely in how far
      they fall short of perfect time-concentration trading. Current studies use a
      structure-activity approach to determine how molecular parameters correlate with 
      how well a compound integrates over time.

TI  - Rural Health and Spiritual Care Development: A Review of Programs across Rural
      Victoria, Australia.
PG  - 928-940
LID - 10.1007/s10943-015-0119-1 [doi]
AB  - Given declining populations in rural areas and diminishing traditional religious 
      support, this research explores whether spiritual care education programs would
      be beneficial for and appreciated by those working in rural health and/or
      community organizations. An overview of literature identified three dominant
      rural health issues affecting the provision of spiritual care in rural areas,
      namely the disparity between rural and urban areas in terms of resources, the
      lack of access to services, plus the need for education and training within rural
      areas. Spiritual Health Victoria Incorporated (Victoria, Australia) sought to
      address these issues with the implementation of a variety of spiritual education 
      programs within rural areas. Results of an evaluation of these programs are
      presented specifying participant demographics, reasons why participants attended,
      their evaluation of the program and any recommendations for future programs. In
      overall terms, the results indicated that at least 90% of participants favorably 
      rated their attended program as either 'very good' or 'good' and indicated that
      the main reason for their attendance was to develop their own education and/or
      practice of spiritual care within their rural context for the benefit of local
      constituents. Several recommendations are made for future programs.

TI  - Gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin combination (GEMOX regimen) in pretreated patients
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a multicenter phase II study.
PG  - 347-52
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the activity and tolerance of gemcitabine in combination
      with oxaliplatin (GEMOX regimen) in pretreated patients with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with advanced
      NSCLC who had disease progression after a cisplatin- and taxane-based front-line 
      regimen were treated with gemcitabine (1500 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) and
      oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) on day 8) every 3 weeks. The patients' median age was 62
      years and the performance status (WHO) was 0 for 11, 1 for 17 and 2 for 4
      patients. The treatment was second line for 22 (69%) and >or=third line for 10
      (31%) patients. RESULTS: Partial response was achieved in 5 (16%) patients,
      stable disease in 8 (25%) and progressive disease in 19 (59%). Two patients with 
      stable disease and one patient with progressive disease while on previous
      chemotherapy experienced a partial response with GEMOX regimen. The median
      duration of response was 2.5 months (range, 1-11.5), the median time to tumor
      progression 3 months (range, 1-18) and the median survival 5.6 months (range,
      1-31). Grade III neutropenia occurred in five (16%) patients, grade III
      thrombocytopenia in two (6%) and grade III anemia in three (9%); moreover, grades
      II-III asthenia was reported in eight (25%) patients and grades II-III
      neurotoxicity in three (9%). CONCLUSION: The GEMOX combination is a relatively
      active and well tolerated second-line regimen in NSCLC patients pretreated with a
      taxane- and/or platinum-based chemotherapy.

TI  - Proteasomes and proteasome activator 200 kDa (PA200) accumulate on chromatin in
      response to ionizing radiation.
PG  - 663-74
AB  - Proteasome activator 200 kDa (PA200) forms nuclear foci after exposure of cells
      to ionizing radiation and enhances proteasome activity in vitro. Within cells, it
      is unclear whether PA200 responds to radiation alone or in association with
      proteasomes. In the present study, we identified three forms of cellular PA200
      (termed PA200i, ii and iii) at the mRNA and protein levels. Neither PA200ii nor
      PA200iii appears to associate with proteasomes. All detectable PA200i is
      associated with proteasomes, which indicates that PA200i and proteasomes function
      together within the cell. Consistent with this idea, we find that exposure of
      cells to radiation leads to an equivalent accumulation of both PA200i and core
      proteasomes on chromatin. This increase in PA200 and proteasomes on chromatin is 
      not specific to the stage of cell cycle arrest since it occurs in cells that
      arrest in G(2)/M and cells that arrest in G(1)/S after exposure to radiation.
      These data provide evidence that PA200 and proteasomes function together within
      cells and respond to a specific radiation-induced damage independent of the stage
      of cell cycle arrest.

TI  - Comparison of MDCT and MRI in the detection and sizing of acute and chronic
      myocardial infarcts.
PG  - 292-9
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared ability of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) 
      to detect and size the myocardial infarctions (MI) with MRI. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Eighty examination sets of MDCT and MRI of 63 consecutive patients in
      the acute stage (average 6.3 days, n=40) and/or chronic stage (average, 11.8
      months; n=40) of reperfused MI were examined in this study. The first-pass and
      delayed MRI was performed using a 1.5 T scanner with an injection of Gd-DTPA to
      assess the extent of MI. Within 24h after MRI, MDCT was performed at the arterial
      phase around 25s with a 10-min delay using one of the following scanners:
      4-slice, 16-slice, and 40-slice. The volume of the MI over the total myocardial
      volume was calculated from the MRI and CT images. RESULTS: MDCT revealed MI
      lesions in all cases except for one (1.3%) on the early phase images. The
      percentage volume of the lesion on the MDCT images correlated with that of the MR
      images. The correlation coefficient between perfusion MRI and early CT was 0.62
      (p<0.0001) and the correlation coefficient between the 5-min delay MRI and late
      CT was 0.81 (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in the average lesion
      volume (%) between perfusion MRI (10.8+/-6.7%) and early CT (12.1+/-8.5%)
      (p>0.05), but there was significant difference between the 5-min delay MRI
      (25.9+/-12.1%) and late CT (22.8+/-11.8%) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: MDCT produces
      comparable results to MRI in the detection and sizing of acute and chronic MI.

TI  - Regulation of intracellular pH by p90Rsk-dependent activation of an Na(+)/H(+)
      exchanger in starfish oocytes.
PG  - 24044-54
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.072553 [doi]
AB  - Starfish oocytes arrest at metaphase of the first meiotic division (MI arrest) in
      the ovary and resume meiosis after spawning into seawater. MI arrest is
      maintained by lower intracellular pH (pH(i)) and release from arrest by cellular 
      alkalization. To elucidate pH(i) regulation in oocytes, we cloned the starfish
      (Asterina pectinifera) Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (ApNHE3) expressed in the plasma
      membrane of oocytes. The cytoplasmic domain of ApNHE3 contains p90 ribosomal S6
      kinase (p90Rsk) phosphorylation sites, and injection of a constitutively active
      p90Rsk and the upstream regulator Mos to immature oocytes, stimulated an increase
      in pH(i). This increase was blocked by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride, a NHE
      inhibitor, and SL0101, a specific Rsk inhibitor. The MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor 
      U0126 blocked the Mos-induced, but not the p90Rsk-induced, pH(i) increase,
      suggesting that the Mos-MEK-MAPK-p90Rsk pathway promotes ApNHE3 activation. In a 
      cell-free extract, the Mos-MEK-MAPK-p90Rsk pathway phosphorylates ApNHE3 at
      Ser-590, -606, and -673. When p90Rsk-dependent ApNHE3 phosphorylation was blocked
      by a dominant-negative C-terminal fragment, or neutralizing antibody, the
      p90Rsk-induced pH(i) increase was suppressed in immature oocytes. However, ApNHE3
      is up-regulated via the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway before
      MAPK activation and the active state is maintained until spawning, suggesting
      that the p90Rsk-dependent ApNHE3 phosphorylation is unlikely to be the primary
      regulatory mechanism involved in MI arrest exit. After meiosis is completed,
      unfertilized eggs maintain their elevated pH(i) ( approximately 7.4) until the
      onset of apoptosis. We suggest that the p90Rsk/ApNHE3-dependent elevation of
      pH(i) increases fertilization success by delaying apoptosis initiation.

TI  - First-trimester assessment of the fetal palate: a novel application of the Volume
      NT algorithm.
PG  - 1443-8
AB  - We describe a new technique that can facilitate the first-trimester examination
      of the fetal palate using the Volume NT algorithm (Samsung Medison, Seoul,
      Korea), a program that automatically detects the exact midsagittal plane of the
      head and is primarily designed for semiautomatic measurement of the nuchal
      translucency thickness. Three-dimensional (3D) data sets from the fetal face were
      captured with Volume NT and subsequently reformatted with the Oblique View
      software to obtain orthogonal views of the primary and secondary palate in
      coronal and axial planes, respectively. By testing this method in selected 3D
      data sets obtained retrospectively (n = 12) and prospectively (n = 28), we were
      able to extract clinically acceptable views of the fetal palate in all cases.
      This preliminary report shows that with this new 3D automation development, early
      evaluation of the fetal palate is feasible and reproducible and could be easily
      incorporated into the first-trimester sonographic protocol once its ability to
      detect abnormal cases is demonstrated.

TI  - Delayed wheat flag leaf senescence due to removal of spikelets is associated with

PG  - 663-70

AB  - Removal of reproductive 'sink' i.e. spikelets from wheat at anthesis delays the
      rate of flag leaf senescence. In this work, the antioxidant defense was studied
      in the flag leaf of Triticum aestivum cv. Kalyansona plants showing normal (S +
      plants) and delayed senescence via removal of spikelets (S- plants). This was
      done by measurement of metabolites and activities of enzymes such as superoxide
      dismutase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase,
      monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione
      reductase. S- plants had higher reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione
      (GSH/GSSG) ratio and antioxidant enzyme activities than the control plants and
      the differences were apparent from 21 days after anthesis (DAA). The removal of
      the reproductive sink led to an increased antioxidant defense which may be
      contributing towards the delayed flag leaf senescence in wheat. Chloroplasts and 
      mitochondria, important sources of ROS, were isolated at two stages representing 
      early (7 DAA) and late (21 DAA) senescence. Oxidative damage to proteins was
      studied in these organelles in relation to SOD and APX. Mitochondria had higher
      levels of damaged proteins than chloroplasts at 7 DAA in both S+ and S- plants.
      Higher damage was related to the lower antioxidant enzyme levels of SOD and APX
      in mitochondria as compared to chloroplasts.

AB  - The present study employed a quantitative survey to ascertain whether the
      external pressure of environmental risk management (ERM) on commercial banks was 
      a contributing factor to their ERM behavior. Data was obtained using
      questionnaires from 204 branches of commercial banks located in the Yangtze River
      Delta of China. The relationship between external pressure and behavior was
      tested using a linear structural relations model through path analysis. The
      results revealed that external pressure of ERM was significantly and positively
      related to the behavior and that pressure from governmental regulations was the
      most important contributing factor in the passive feedback behavior and
      preventive behavior of commercial banks. The pressure from markets was the most
      important contributing factor in banks' active participation behavior; the
      pressure from community and NGOs was the most important contributing factor in
      their enthusiastic behavior.

TI  - [Liver transplantation--indications, surgical technique, results--the analysis of
      a clinical series of 200 cases].
PG  - 177-86
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Initially considered experimental, liver transplantation (LT) has
      become the treatment of choice for the patients with end-stage liver diseases.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April 2000 and October 2009, 200 LTs (10 reLTs)
      were performed in 190 patients, this study being retrospective. There were
      transplanted 110 men and 80 women, 159 adults and 31 children with the age
      between 1 and 64 years old (mean age--39.9). The main indication in the adult
      group was represented by viral cirrhosis, while the pediatric series the etiology
      was mainly glycogenosis and biliary atresia. There were performed 143 whole graft
      LTs, 46 living donor LTs, 6 split LTs, 4 reduced LTs and one domino LT RESULTS:
      The postoperative survival was 90% (170 patients). The patient and graft one-year
      and five-year survivals were 76.9%, 73.6% and 71%, 68.2%, respectively. The early
      complications occurred in 127 patients (67%). The late complications were
      recorded in 71 patients (37.3%). The intraoperative and early postoperative
      mortality rate was 9.5% (18 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The Romanian liver
      transplantation program from Fundeni includes all types of current surgical
      techniques and the results are comparable with those from other international
      centers.

AB  - Most cognitive neuroscience theories have focused on the functions of individual 
      brain regions, but cognitive abilities depend also on functional interactions
      among multiple regions. Many recent studies on these interactions have examined
      large-scale, resting-state networks, but these networks are difficult to link to 
      theories about specific cognitive processes. Cognitive theories are easier to
      link to the mini-networks we call process specific alliances (PSAs). A PSA is a
      small team of brain regions that rapidly assemble to mediate a cognitive process 
      in response to task demands but quickly disassemble when the process is no longer
      needed. We compare PSAs to resting-state networks and to other
      connectivity-based, task-related networks, and we characterize the advantages and
      disadvantages of each type of network.

TI  - Perioperative outcomes in hybrid versus conventional surgical coronary artery
      revascularisation.
PG  - 292-6
LID - 10.1510/icvts.2010.239178 [doi]
AB  - A best evidence topic was written on perioperative outcomes in hybrid coronary
      revascularisation according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was 
      'In patients with stable multivessel coronary artery disease, does the use of
      hybrid coronary revascularisation compared to conventional and off-pump coronary 
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality?' Six 
      hundred and twenty-three papers were found in the literature search. From these
      results, six comparative studies and one review paper appeared to be relevant.
      The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied,
      study type, relevant results and weaknesses of these papers were compiled and
      tabulated. Critical appraisal ruled out three of the six comparative studies
      identified by the search. Therefore, the following papers constituted best
      evidence. de Canniere et al. reported a non-randomised retrospective comparison
      of staged hybrid revascularisation with conventional CABG, showing an association
      with shorter intensive care unit and total hospital stays, as well as shorter
      time to return to work. Kon et al. reported a non-randomised retrospective
      comparison of simultaneous hybrid revascularisation with off-pump CABG, showing
      that fewer blood transfusions were required in addition to shorter intensive care
      and hospital stays. Vassiliades et al. reported a non-randomised retrospective
      comparison of staged hybrid revascularisation with off-pump CABG, which failed to
      show a difference between 30-day major adverse cardiac events in the two patient 
      groups. DeRose reviewed 13 published series of hybrid revascularisation cases,
      concluding that experienced centres should consider hybrid revascularisation as
      an appropriate alternative to conventional CABG for selected patients. In
      summary, these papers provide limited evidence of improved perioperative outcomes
      in both staged and simultaneous hybrid revascularisation compared to CABG.
      Weaknesses of the comparative studies include the lack of mid-term and long-term 
      follow-up and the difficulty of generalising results from specialist units to
      general cardiac surgical practice. A large randomised control trial comparing
      hybrid revascularisation and coronary artery bypass with mid-term follow-up will 
      be required to establish the clinical effectiveness of this procedure.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate possible relationships between the 
      genotypes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
      (CTL) responses. HBV genotypes, HBV specific CTL HBV DNA and other markers of HBV
      infection were determined in 138 patients with chronic hepatitis B. The results
      showed that the patients infected with genotype C (n=62) had a significantly
      lower HBV-specific CTL response than those who were infected with HBV genotype B 
      (P<0.01). HBV DNA titer was higher in patients infected with HBV genotype C than 
      in those infected with HBV genotype B (P<0.01). Both alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were higher in HBV genotype C infected patients 
      than in those infected with genotype B (P<0.01 and <0.05, respectively). These
      results suggest that compared with CHB patients infected with HBV genotype B, the
      higher HBV DNA level and more severe liver damages in the patients infected with 
      genotype C of HBV may be associated with genotype C of the virus.

TI  - Molecular and clinical analysis of 27 German patients with Leber congenital
      amaurosis.
PG  - e0205380
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0205380 [doi]
AB  - Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest and most severe form of all
      inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) and the most frequent cause of inherited
      blindness in children. The phenotypic overlap with other early-onset and severe
      IRDs as well as difficulties associated with the ophthalmic examination of
      infants can complicate the clinical diagnosis. To date, 25 genes have been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of LCA. The disorder is usually inherited in an
      autosomal recessive fashion, although rare dominant cases have been reported. We 
      report the mutation spectra and frequency of genes in 27 German index patients
      initially diagnosed with LCA. A total of 108 LCA- and other genes implicated in
      IRD were analysed using a cost-effective targeted next-generation sequencing
      procedure based on molecular inversion probes (MIPs). Sequencing and variant
      filtering led to the identification of putative pathogenic variants in 25 cases, 
      thereby leading to a detection rate of 93%. The mutation spectrum comprises 34
      different alleles, 17 of which are novel. In line with previous studies, the
      genetic results led to a revision of the initial clinical diagnosis in a
      substantial proportion of cases, demonstrating the importance of genetic testing 
      in IRD. In addition, our detection rate of 93% shows that MIPs are a
      cost-efficient and sensitive tool for targeted next-generation sequencing in IRD.

TI  - Testing the link between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in a
      Minnesota grassland experiment.
PG  - e52821
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0052821 [doi]
AB  - The functional diversity of a community can influence ecosystem functioning and
      reflects assembly processes. The large number of disparate metrics used to
      quantify functional diversity reflects the range of attributes underlying this
      concept, generally summarized as functional richness, functional evenness, and
      functional divergence. However, in practice, we know very little about which
      attributes drive which ecosystem functions, due to a lack of field-based tests.
      Here we test the association between eight leading functional diversity metrics
      (Rao's Q, FD, FDis, FEve, FDiv, convex hull volume, and species and functional
      group richness) that emphasize different attributes of functional diversity, plus
      11 extensions of these existing metrics that incorporate heterogeneous species
      abundances and trait variation. We assess the relationships among these metrics
      and compare their performances for predicting three key ecosystem functions
      (above- and belowground biomass and light capture) within a long-term grassland
      biodiversity experiment. Many metrics were highly correlated, although unique
      information was captured in FEve, FDiv, and dendrogram-based measures (FD) that
      were adjusted by abundance. FD adjusted by abundance outperformed all other
      metrics in predicting both above- and belowground biomass, although several
      others also performed well (e.g. Rao's Q, FDis, FDiv). More generally,
      trait-based richness metrics and hybrid metrics incorporating multiple diversity 
      attributes outperformed evenness metrics and single-attribute metrics, results
      that were not changed when combinations of metrics were explored. For light
      capture, species richness alone was the best predictor, suggesting that traits
      for canopy architecture would be necessary to improve predictions. Our study
      provides a comprehensive test linking different attributes of functional
      diversity with ecosystem function for a grassland system.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Total hip arthroplasty (THA) in
      treating the hip joint involvement of Psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: From
      January 2005 to December 2016, a total of 15 PsA patients (20 hip joints)
      underwent THA in Department of Orthopaedics, Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.
      All the patients had obvious restriction in daily life before operation. The mean
      Harris score was 25.2 averagely and the mean total range of the hip joint
      movement was 39.6 degrees before surgery. All the prosthesis were biotype and
      ceramic to ceramic. Results: All patients were followed up with an average of
      35.7 months and could take care of themselves. The Harris score of hip joint was 
      83.2 averagely, including 15 hips excellent, 3 good, and 2 passable, with an
      excellent and good rate of 90%. The mean total range of the hip joint movement
      was 175 degrees after surgery. There was no infection, nerve injury or loosening 
      of the prosthesis. 1 hip appeared avulsion fracture of greater trochanter of
      femur, and the joint function was satisfying at the last time of follow-up.
      Conclusion: THA is an effective method in treating affected hip joint of PsA. It 
      can restore the hip function and improve the life quality of the PsA patients.

TI  - Genetic and molecular mechanisms of aluminum tolerance in plants.
PG  - 1949-57
LID - 10.4238/2012.July.19.14 [doi]
AB  - Aluminum (Al) toxicity restricts root growth and agricultural yield in acid
      soils, which constitute approximately 40% of the potentially arable lands
      worldwide. The two main mechanisms of Al tolerance in plants are internal
      detoxification of Al and its exclusion from root cells. Genes encoding membrane
      transporters and accessory transcription factors, as well as cis-elements that
      enhance gene expression, are involved in Al tolerance in plants; thus studies of 
      these genes and accessory factors should be the focus of molecular breeding
      efforts aimed at improving Al tolerance in crops. In this review, we describe the
      main genetic and molecular studies that led to the identification and cloning of 
      genes associated with Al tolerance in plants. We include recent findings on the
      regulation of genes associated with Al tolerance. Understanding the genetic,
      molecular, and physiological aspects of Al tolerance in plants is important for
      generating cultivars adapted to acid soils, thereby contributing to food security
      worldwide.

TI  - Substrate Recognition of Glycoprotein Folding Sensor UGGT Analyzed by

      Prepared by Parallel Native Chemical Ligation.
PG  - 11421-11426
LID - 10.1021/jacs.7b03277 [doi]
AB  - UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) distinguishes glycoproteins
      in non-native conformations from those in native conformations and glucosylates
      from only non-native glycoproteins. To analyze how UGGT recognizes non-native
      glycoproteins, we chemically synthesized site-specifically (15)N-labeled
      interleukin 8 (IL-8) C-terminal (34-72) glycopeptides bearing a Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) 
      oligosaccharide. Chemical shift perturbation mapping NMR experiments suggested
      that Phe65 of the glycopeptide specifically interacts with UGGT. To analyze this 
      interaction, we constructed a glycopeptide library by varying Phe65 with 10 other
      natural amino acids, via parallel native chemical ligation between a
      glycopeptide-alpha-thioester and a peptide library consisting of 11 peptides.
      UGGT assay against the glycopeptide library revealed that, although less
      hydrophobic glycopeptides could be used as substrates for UGGT, hydrophobic
      glycopeptides are preferred.

TI  - Accuracy of proximal caries depth measurements: comparison between limited cone
      beam computed tomography, storage phosphor and film radiography.
PG  - 202-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of limited cone beam computed
      tomography (LCBCT), an image plate system and F-speed film in assessing the depth
      of proximal carious lesions. Radiographs of a dry mandible with sound and carious
      teeth were obtained with all three methods. In 41 molar and premolar proximal
      surfaces, 2 observers independently measured lesion depth on the images from the 
      three modalities. The correlation of measurements was assessed with Pearson's
      correlation analysis. Results from imaging modalities and histological sectioning
      (gold standard) were compared using Bland-Altman plots. Overall comparison of the
      depth measurements from the imaging modalities and the gold standard was done
      using repeated-measures ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons of systems were done by the
      Bonferroni t test. The correlation between the measurements of the two observers 
      was 0.977 for film, 0.997 for image plate system and 0.998 for LCBCT.
      Bland-Altman plots revealed that LCBCT agreed very closely with the gold standard
      while the agreement between the latter and the image plate--or film--images was
      moderate. The mean difference and 95% limits of agreement between LCBCT and the
      gold standard were smaller than those between either image plate or F-speed film 
      and the gold standard. The LCBCT method appears as a promising tool for detection
      and monitoring of proximal carious lesions.

TI  - Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to Higgs boson production in association
      with a top quark pair and a jet.
PG  - 171801
AB  - We present the calculation of the cross section for Higgs boson production in
      association with a top quark pair plus one jet, at next-to-leading-order accuracy
      in QCD. All mass dependence is retained without recurring to any approximation.
      After including the complete next-to-leading-order QCD corrections, we observe a 
      strong reduction in the scale dependence of the result. We also show
      distributions for the invariant mass of the top quark pair, with and without the 
      additional jet, and for the transverse momentum and the pseudorapidity of the
      Higgs boson. Results for the virtual contributions are obtained with a novel
      reduction approach based on integrand decomposition via the Laurent expansion, as
      implemented in the library, NINJA. Cross sections and differential distributions 
      are obtained with an automated setup which combines the GOSAM and SHERPA
      frameworks.

AB  - The microbiological transformation of the triterpene nigranoic acid
      (3,4-secocycloarta-4(28),24(Z)-diene-3,26-dioic acid) (1) to
      3,4-secocycloarta-4(28),17(20),24(Z)-triene-7beta-hydroxy-16beta,26-lactone-3-oic
      acid (2) and
      3,4-secocycloarta-4(28),17(20)(Z),24(Z)-triene-7beta-hydroxy-16beta-methoxy-3,26-
      dioic acid (3) by the freshwater fungus Dictyosporium heptasporum YMF1.01213 has 
      been demonstrated. The structures of the biotransformation products were
      determined by spectroscopic and MS analyses. Compound 2, characterized by the
      presence of a formed C-16/C-26 ester bridge, provided a novel nine-membered
      lactone ring structural skeleton for 3,4-secocycloartane triterpenoid
      derivatives. In addition, Compounds 1-3 exhibited weak anti-HIV activity in
      vitro. Compounds 2 and 3 were reported for the first time as natural product
      derivatives.

TI  - Epidemiology and transmission characteristics of human adenovirus type 7 caused
      acute respiratory disease outbreak in military trainees in East China.
PG  - 2331-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus type 7 (HAdV7) is globally attracting great concern 
      as its high morbidity and severity in respiratory diseases, especially in Asia.
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of HAdV7
      infection outbreak in East China. METHODS: The clinical samples were collected
      from the patients of an ARD outbreak in East Chinafor the detection of causative 
      pathogens by multiplex PCR. The molecular type of human adenovirus isolates were 
      identified by sequencing and homologous comparison based on their hexon genes.
      The spatiotemporal dynamics of global HAdV7 was investigated using the
      phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses. Total 67 referenced HAdV7 hexon
      sequences (>800 bp) from GenBank were selected for constructing the maximum
      likelihood tree by MEGA 5.1.0, grouped according to the tree topology for the
      further migration analysis by PAUP* 4.0 and MigraPhyla 1.0 b to understand the
      transmission patterns of HAdV7 in global epidemics. RESULTS: The results showed
      HAdV7 as the causative pathogen in this outbreak, and the outbreak strains had
      the hexon sequences highly identical with the isolates in Shaanxi (2012). The
      origin of HAdV7 was inferred as California, meanwhile a total of 21 migration
      routes were acquired. HAdV7 in this outbreak was statistically proven dispersed
      from Shaanxi province (2012). CONCLUSIONS: The analyses of epidemiology and
      transmission pattern of HAdV7 would not only enrich the molecular biological
      basic database but also provide theoretical basis for HAdV7 prevention and
      control strategy.

TI  - Transmission of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus between mothers and
      children in a South African population.
PG  - 351-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess whether Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) with
      or without HIV coinfection in South African mothers is associated with higher
      KSHV seropositivity in their children. METHODS: We tested sera from 1287 South
      African children and 1179 mothers using assays for KSHV lytic K8.1 and latent
      ORF73 antigens. We computed odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      to assess associations between KSHV serostatus and risk factors. RESULTS: KSHV
      seroprevalence was 15.9% (204 of 1287 subjects) in children and 29.7% (350 of
      1179 subjects) in mothers. The risk of KSHV seropositivity was significantly
      higher in children of KSHV-seropositive mothers compared with those of
      KSHV-seronegative mothers. The HIV status of mothers was marginally associated
      with an increased risk of KSHV seropositivity in their children (OR = 1.6, 95%
      CI: 1.0 to 2.6; P = 0.07). KSHV seroprevalence was significantly higher in
      HIV-infected subjects (P = 0.0005), and HIV-infected subjects had significantly
      higher lytic and latent KSHV antibody levels than HIV-negative subjects.
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of acquisition of KSHV was higher among children of
      KSHV-seropositive mothers. Although KSHV seroprevalence was significantly higher 
      in children and mothers who were infected with HIV, the HIV status of the mother 
      was only marginally associated with an increased risk of KSHV seropositivity in
      the child.

TI  - Anemia Treatment by Erythropoiesis-stimulating Agents during the 6 Months before 
      the Initiation of Hemodialysis: Comparison of Darbepoetin Alfa and Continuous
      Erythropoietin Receptor Activator.
PG  - 44-50
LID - 10.2302/kjm.2016-0009-OA [doi]
AB  - Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for cardiovascular
      diseases and is treated by long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). 
      Although the results of previous studies have shown that hemoglobin levels could 
      not be maintained at the initiation of dialysis in CKD patients treated with
      recombinant human erythropoietin, it remains undetermined whether long-acting
      ESAs are effective in preventing the progression of anemia at the initiation of
      dialysis. In the present study, hemoglobin levels in 40 CKD patients treated with
      darbepoetin alfa (DA) and 15 CKD patients treated with a continuous
      erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) were retrospectively compared during the
      6 months period before the initiation of dialysis. Results showed that DA and
      CERA both maintained hemoglobin levels at around 10 g/dL from 6 months to 1 month
      before dialysis. However, hemoglobin levels at the initiation of dialysis
      significantly decreased to 9.1 +/- 1.2 g/dL in the DA group and to 9.0 +/- 1.0
      g/dL in the CERA group. Although the total doses of ESAs used during the 6-month 
      period were similar between the two groups, DA-treated CKD patients received
      subcutaneous injections more frequently than did patients treated with CERA.
      These results suggest that CKD patients require more intense ESA therapy to
      prevent a decline in hemoglobin levels at the initiation of dialysis, including
      those treated with long-acting ESAs. The results also raise the possibility that 
      CERA is more useful than DA for reducing the number of injections during the
      pre-dialysis period.

TI  - Interactions between glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT-1) and some inhibitor
      molecules - glycine transporter type 1 and its inhibitors (review).
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1556/APhysiol.99.2012.1.1 [doi]
AB  - Glycine is a mandatory positive allosteric modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors in the central nervous system.
      Elevation of glycine concentrations by inhibition of its reuptake in the vicinity
      of NMDA receptors may positively influence receptor functions as glycine B
      binding site on NR1 receptor subunit is not saturated in physiological
      conditions. Synaptic and extrasynaptic concentrations of glycine are regulated by
      its type-1 glycine transporter, which is primarily expressed in astroglial and
      glutamatergic cell membranes. Alteration of synaptic glycine levels may have
      importance in the treatment of various forms of endogenous psychosis
      characterized by hypofunctional NMDA receptors. Several lines of evidence
      indicate that impaired NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission is 
      involved in development of the negative (and partly the positive) symptoms and
      the cognitive deficit in schizophrenia. Inhibitors of glycine transporter type-1 
      may represent a newly developed therapeutic intervention in treatment of this
      mental illness. We have synthesized a novel series of N-substituted sarcosines,
      analogues of the glycine transporter-1 inhibitor NFPS
      (N-[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3-(4'-phenylphenoxy)-propyl]sarcosine). Of the
      pyridazinone-containing compounds, SzV-1997 was found to be a potent glycine
      transporter-1 inhibitor in rat brain synaptosomes and it markedly increased
      extracellular glycine concentrations in conscious rat striatum. SzV-1997 did not 
      exhibit toxic symptoms such as hyperlocomotion, restless movements, respiratory
      depression, and lethality, characteristic for NFPS. Besides pyridazinone-based,
      sarcosine-containing glycine transporter-1 inhibitors, a series of substrate-type
      amino acid inhibitors was investigated in order to obtain better insight into the
      ligand-binding characteristics of the substrate binding cavity of the
      transporter.

LID - 10.12968/bjon.2016.25.15.S14 [doi]
AB  - This article describes how an interprofessional project in a London NHS
      Foundation Trust was undertaken to develop an intranet-based medical
      device-related pressure ulcer prevention and management pathway for clinical
      staff working across an adult critical care directorate, where life-threatening
      events require interventions using medical devices. The aim of this project was
      to improve working policies and processes to define key prevention strategies and
      provide clinicians with a clear, standardised approach to risk and skin

TI  - Wilson Disease: Epigenetic effects of choline supplementation on phenotype and
      clinical course in a mouse model.
PG  - 804-818
AB  - Wilson disease (WD), a genetic disorder affecting copper transport, is
      characterized by hepatic and neurological manifestations with variable and often 
      unpredictable presentation. Global DNA methylation in liver was previously
      modified by dietary choline in tx-j mice, a spontaneous mutant model of WD. We
      therefore hypothesized that the WD phenotype and hepatic gene expression of tx-j 
      offspring could be modified by maternal methyl supplementation during pregnancy. 
      In an initial experiment, female tx-j mice or wild type mice were fed control or 
      choline-supplemented diets 2 weeks prior to mating through embryonic day 17.
      Transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) on embryonic livers revealed tx-j-specific
      differences in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial
      dysfunction, and the neurological disorders Huntington's disease and Alzheimer
      disease. Maternal choline supplementation restored the transcript levels of a
      subset of genes to wild type levels. In a separate experiment, a group of tx-j
      offspring continued to receive choline-supplemented or control diets, with or
      without the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA) for 12 weeks until 24 weeks of
      age. Combined choline supplementation and PCA treatment of 24-week-old tx-j mice 
      was associated with increased liver transcript levels of methionine metabolism
      and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes. Sex differences in gene expression
      within each treatment group were also observed. These results demonstrate that
      the transcriptional changes in oxidative phosphorylation and methionine
      metabolism genes in WD that originate during fetal life are, in part, prevented
      by prenatal maternal choline supplementation, a finding with potential relevance 
      to preventive treatments of WD.

LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether ethnic differences in serum anti-Mullerian hormone
      (AMH) exist in a population of subfertile women presenting to a fertility clinic.
      DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Homerton University
      Hospital Fertility Centre, London, UK. POPULATION: A total of 865 women attending
      the fertility clinic for their first consultation appointment between September
      2012 and September 2013. METHODS: Serum AMH was compared amongst women from five 
      different ethnic groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum AMH and ethnicity were the 
      primary outcome variables. RESULTS: Although initial comparison showed South
      Asian women to have a higher serum AMH, compared with white European and
      Afro-Caribbean women (F = 3.817; P < 0.005), South Asian women attending the
      clinic were significantly younger and less likely to be smokers than women from
      other ethnic groups. The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was
      significantly higher in South Asian and South East Asian women than in other
      ethnic groups. Differences in serum AMH were no longer significant after
      controlling for confounding factors: age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking
      status with (P = 0.869) and without (P = 0.215) controlling for PCOS. CONCLUSION:
      The results from our study show that there was no independent association of
      ethnicity and serum AMH levels in an unselected population of women attending the
      fertility clinic.

TI  - Single Crystalline Iron Silicide and Beta-Iron Disilicide Nanowires Formed
      through Chemical Vapor Deposition.
LID - E2384 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma11122384 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we report the synthesis of iron silicide and beta-iron disilicide 
      nanowires with chemical vapor deposition; remarkably, the latter has drawn much
      attention but has seldom been achieved. We also propose the formation mechanisms 
      for the two phases. To investigate the effects of the growth parameters on
      compositions and morphologies of the iron silicide nanowires, we changed and
      studied the reaction time, substrate temperature, position of samples, and
      pressure. The reaction concentration was found to be altered by all of the
      parameters; thus, we observed different nanowires in terms of morphologies and
      compositions with scanning electron microscopy. To confirm the growth direction
      and crystal structure of the nanowires, we conducted x-ray diffraction and
      high-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies. With the potential of
      being utilized as circuit elements in electronic devices for Schottky barriers,
      ohmic contacts, and interconnection among silicon-based transistors, the silicide
      work at nanoscale is beneficial for nanoelectronics. Understanding the effects of
      these growth parameters facilitates the control of nanowire growth with better
      quality.

TI  - Monitoring super- and subsurface oxygen on Ag(210) by high energy resolution
      X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: subsurface diffusion and segregation.
PG  - 942-7
AB  - We report on a high energy resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy plus
      supersonic molecular beam investigation of O/Ag(210). Two components are detected
      in the O1s spectra upon O2 adsorption, at binding energies EB=527.7 and 529.6 eV.
      The former peak persists up to 470 K, while the latter one decreases abruptly
      above 280 K. Comparison with a previous vibrational spectroscopy investigation on
      the same system (L. Vattuone, et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2003, 90, 228302) allows to
      assign both features to atomic oxygen. The low-energy peak is identified with
      adatoms, while the other is correlated to O atoms in subsurface sites. A minor
      contribution at the same binding energy, due to carbonates, is quantified by
      inspection of the C1s region and shows a different temperature behavior with
      respect to oxygen. Oxygen segregation into the subsurface region is observed when
      heating the crystal in the presence of supersurface oxygen.

PG  - 355-66
LID - 10.3109/10641955.2013.807821 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women with impaired insulin sensitivity are at risk for
      developing pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders (PIHD). We analyzed glucose
      and insulin circulating levels throughout a 2-h oral 75 g glucose tolerance test 
      in pregnant women, and related the 2-h insulinemias to PIHD prevalence. METHODS: 
      Pregnant women (gestational week 24-28) were submitted to a glucose overload, and
      glucose and insulin plasma concentrations were measured throughout the test.
      These peripheral metabolite levels, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)
      values and the glucose to insulin ratio (G:Ir) were analyzed. Anthropometric
      parameters and pregnancy outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Women with normal
      fasting glycemia, insulinemia and HOMA values, G:Ir and 2 h-glycemia but whose 2 
      h-insulinemia was higher than 215.25 pM were at greater risk for developing late 
      pregnancy hypertension and preeclampsia compared to women of similar
      characteristics but whose 2 h-insulinemias were lower than 215.25 pM. CONCLUSION:
      2-h insulinemias higher than 215.25 pM after a 75 g glucose overload could be
      highly indicative of women at increased risk of developing PIHD.

      levels in the blood over a prolonged period. When left untreated, it can lead to 
      long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetic
      retinopathy or foot ulcers. Approximately 415 million people (about 8.3% of the
      world's population) had diabetes worldwide in 2015, with 90% of the cases
      classified as Type 2 DM, which is caused by insulin resistance that arises mostly
      from being overweight and from a lack of exercise. DM affects every part of the
      body, including the erythrocytes. The aim of the present report is to gain
      insight into the damage done to the erythrocytes of patients classified with
      pre-diabetes and diabetes (plenty are found in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a
      country where young people encompass a large segment of the population). The
      study presents results on the morphological analysis of erythrocytes by atomic
      force microscopy (AFM) and molecular investigations by fluorescence spectroscopy 
      (FS). Our results indicate significant differences (in the morphology, size, and 
      hemolytic end products) between the erythrocytes of diabetic patients (HbA1C,
      glycated hemoglobin, levels of 8(-)10%) and normal controls. It is well-known
      that DM and smoking are two major contributory factors for cardiovascular
      diseases (CVDs), and our observations presented in this study suggest that
      diabetes plays a relatively less damaging role than smoking for CVD.

AB  - Previously we identified palmitoyl-, oleoyl-, linoleoyl-, and
      arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 16:0, 18:1, 18:2 and 20:4) as the most 
      prominent LPC species generated by endothelial lipase (EL). In the present study,
      we examined the impact of those LPC on acetylcholine (ACh)- induced vascular
      relaxation. All tested LPC attenuated ACh-induced relaxation, measured ex vivo,
      using mouse aortic rings and wire myography. The rank order of potency was as
      follows: 18:2>20:4>16:0>18:1. The attenuating effect of LPC 16:0 on relaxation
      was augmented by indomethacin-mediated cyclooxygenase (COX)-inhibition and
      CAY10441, a prostacyclin (PGI2)- receptor (IP) antagonist. Relaxation attenuated 
      by LPC 20:4 and 18:2 was improved by indomethacin and SQ29548, a thromboxane A2
      (TXA2)- receptor antagonist. The effect of LPC 20:4 could also be improved by
      TXA2- and PGI2-synthase inhibitors. As determined by EIA assays, the tested LPC
      promoted secretion of PGI2, TXA2, PGF2alpha, and PGE2, however, with markedly
      different potencies. LPC 16:0 was the most potent inducer of superoxide anion
      production by mouse aortic rings, followed by LPC 18:2, 20:4 and 18:1,
      respectively. The strong antioxidant tempol recovered relaxation impairment
      caused by LPC 18:2, 18:1 and 20:4, but not by LPC 16:0. The tested LPC attenuate 
      ACh-induced relaxation through induction of proconstricting prostanoids and
      superoxide anions. The potency of attenuating relaxation and the relative
      contribution of underlying mechanisms are strongly related to LPC acyl-chain
      length and degree of saturation.

AB  - Attention is critical to perception, serving to select behaviorally relevant
      information for privileged processing. To understand the neural mechanisms of
      attention, we must discern how attentional modulation varies by cell type and
      across cortical layers. Here, we test whether attention acts non-selectively
      across cortical layers or whether it engages the laminar circuit in specific and 
      selective ways. We find layer- and cell-class-specific differences in several
      different forms of attentional modulation in area V4. Broad-spiking neurons in
      the superficial layers exhibit attention-mediated increases in firing rate and
      decreases in variability. Spike count correlations are highest in the input layer
      and attention serves to reduce these correlations. Superficial and input layer
      neurons exhibit attention-dependent decreases in low-frequency (<10 Hz)
      coherence, but deep layer neurons exhibit increases in coherence in the beta and 
      gamma frequency ranges. Our study provides a template for attention-mediated
      laminar information processing that might be applicable across sensory
      modalities.

TI  - Fast chromatographic method for the determination of dyes in beverages by using
      high performance liquid chromatography--diode array detection data and second
      order algorithms.
PG  - 7063-70
LID - 10.1016/j.chroma.2009.08.077 [doi]
AB  - A fast chromatographic methodology is presented for the analysis of three
      synthetic dyes in non-alcoholic beverages: amaranth (E123), sunset yellow FCF
      (E110) and tartrazine (E102). Seven soft drinks (purchased from a local
      supermarket) were homogenized, filtered and injected into the chromatographic
      system. Second order data were obtained by a rapid LC separation and DAD
      detection. A comparative study of the performance of two second order algorithms 
      (MCR-ALS and U-PLS/RBL) applied to model the data, is presented. Interestingly,
      the data present time shift between different chromatograms and cannot be
      conveniently corrected to determine the above-mentioned dyes in beverage samples.
      This fact originates the lack of trilinearity that cannot be conveniently
      pre-processed and can hardly be modelled by using U-PLS/RBL algorithm. On the
      contrary, MCR-ALS has shown to be an excellent tool for modelling this kind of
      data allowing to reach acceptable figures of merit. Recovery values ranged
      between 97% and 105% when analyzing artificial and real samples were indicative
      of the good performance of the method. In contrast with the complete separation, 
      which consumes 10 mL of methanol and 3 mL of 0.08 mol L(-1) ammonium acetate, the
      proposed fast chromatography method requires only 0.46 mL of methanol and 1.54 mL
      of 0.08 mol L(-1) ammonium acetate. Consequently, analysis time could be reduced 
      up to 14.2% of the necessary time to perform the complete separation allowing
      saving both solvents and time, which are related to a reduction of both the costs
      per analysis and environmental impact.

TI  - Tridimensional finite element analysis of teeth movement induced by different
      headgear forces.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/s40510-016-0130-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to simulate the actions of low-pull (LP), high-pull 
      (HP), and combined pull (CP) headgears (HGs) and to analyze tooth movement
      tendencies through finite element analysis. METHODS: Tomographic slices of a
      human maxilla with complete permanent dentition were processed by reconstruction 
      software, and the triangular surface mesh was converted into non-uniform rational
      B-spline (NURBS) curves. An HG facial bow was also modulated in 3D. The teeth and
      bone were considered to have isotropic and linear behavior, whereas the
      periodontal ligament was considered to have non-linear and hyperelastic behavior.
      Data regarding the application points, directions and magnitudes of forces were
      obtained from the literature and from a dolichofacial patient with class II,
      division 1 malocclusion, who was treated with a CP HG. RESULTS: The CP HG
      promoted 37.1 to 41.1 %, and the HP HG promoted 19.1 to 31.9 % of LP
      distalization. The HP HG presented the highest intrusion, and the LP HG presented
      the highest extrusion of the first molar. The LP HG contracted the distal side,
      and the HP and CP HGs contracted the lingual and distobuccal roots of the second 
      molar to a lesser degree. CONCLUSIONS: The LP HG promotes the greatest
      distalization, followed by the CP and HP HGs; the LP HG causes greater extrusion 
      of the first molar, and the HP HG causes greater intrusion of the first molar.
      The LP HG causes greater contraction of the second molar than the HP HG.

TI  - Helminth parasites of eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) from
      southern Indiana, USA.

AB  - Very little is known about parasitic diseases of eastern box turtles (Terrapene
      carolina carolina). The objective of this study was to examine the parasitic
      fauna of eastern box turtles collected from southern Indiana, USA. Turtles (n =
      40) were salvaged mostly as road kills from southern Indiana between May and
      October 2009. Seven species of helminths in total were found parasitizing the
      gastrointestinal tract, including two digenean trematodes (Brachycoelium
      salamandrae and Telorchis robustus) and five nematodes (Oswaldocruzia pipiens,
      Cosmocercoides dukae, Falcaustra affinis, F. chelydrae and Serpinema
      trispinosus). We report prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of infection for
      all helminths. Helminths were not found in any other organs examined (heart,
      gonads, liver, heart, kidney and urinary bladder) and no ectoparasites were
      found. Overall, mean intensity of infections was low (1-14 parasites/host),
      suggesting that these parasites are unlikely to be associated with negative
      health impacts. This constitutes the first study of this kind for Indiana.

AB  - Guided selection provides a powerful tool for humanization of the preexisting
      nonhuman antibodies as exemplified by HUMIRA, the world's first human antibody
      approved. This chapter describes the sequential guided selection procedure in
      which mouse VL and VH domains are replaced sequentially with human VL and VH,
      respectively to derive completely human antibody. The detailed protocols for
      construction of phage-displayed antibody library, panning, screening, and
      characterization, are included to achieve successful selection of human antibody 
      with similar characteristics to original mouse antibody.

TI  - The clathrin adaptor Gga2p is a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate effector at the 
      Golgi exit.
PG  - 1991-2002
LID - 10.1091/mbc.E06-10-0937 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) is a key regulator of membrane
      transport required for the formation of transport carriers from the trans-Golgi
      network (TGN). The molecular mechanisms of PI(4)P signaling in this process are
      still poorly understood. In a search for PI(4)P effector molecules, we performed 
      a screen for synthetic lethals in a background of reduced PI(4)P and found the
      gene GGA2. Our analysis uncovered a PI(4)P-dependent recruitment of the clathrin 
      adaptor Gga2p to the TGN during Golgi-to-endosome trafficking. Gga2p recruitment 
      to liposomes is stimulated both by PI(4)P and the small GTPase Arf1p in its
      active conformation, implicating these two molecules in the recruitment of Gga2p 
      to the TGN, which ultimately controls the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. 
      PI(4)P binding occurs through a phosphoinositide-binding signature within the
      N-terminal VHS domain of Gga2p resembling a motif found in other clathrin
      interacting proteins. These data provide an explanation for the TGN-specific
      membrane recruitment of Gga2p.

AB  - Incorporation of gallium (III) nitrate into unsupplemented Sabouraud Dextrose
      Agar to a final concentration of 512 mg/l (2 mM) suppressed bacterial growth, of 
      the following genera Escherichia, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Listeria, Pseudomonas
      and Staphylococcus, In contrast growth of Burkholderia cenocepacia, and yeast and
      filamentous fungi was not affected. Supplementation of selective mycological
      media with gallium (III) may aid in the selectivity of such media, particularly
      where clinical specimens are heavily contaminated with bacterial co-habitants and
      where antibiotic resistance in such bacterial flora may render antibiotic
      supplements ineffective.

TI  - Three dimensional finite element analysis of the influence of posterior tibial
      slope on the anterior cruciate ligament and knee joint forward stability.
PG  - 629-636
LID - 10.3233/BMR-169703 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the biomechanical influence of posterior tibial angle on
      the anterior cruciate ligament and knee joint forward stability. METHODS: The
      left knee joint of a healthy volunteer was scanned by CT and MRI. The data were
      imported into Mimics software to obtain 3D models of bone, cartilage, meniscus
      and ligament structures, and then Geomagic software was used to modify of the
      image. The relative displacement between tibia and femur and the stress of ACL
      were recorded. RESULTS: ACL tension was 12.195 N in model with 2 composite
      function PTS, 12.639 N in model with 7 composite function PTS, 18.658 N in model 
      with 12 composite function PTS. the relative displacement of the tibia and femur 
      was 2.735 mm in model with 2 composite function PTS, 3.086 mm in model with 7
      composite function PTS, 3.881 mm in model with 12 composite function PTS. In the 
      model with 30 composite function flexion, the maximum tension of ACL was 24.585 N
      in model with 2 composite function PTS, 25.612 N in model with 7 composite
      function PTS, 31.481 N in model with 12 composite function PTS. The relative
      displacement of the tibia and femur was 5.590 mm in model with 2 composite
      function PTS, 6.721 mm in model with 7 composite function PTS, 6.952 mm in model 
      with 12 composite function PTS. In the 90 composite function flexion models, ACL 
      tension was 5.119 N in model with 2 composite function PTS, 8.674 N in model with
      7 composite function PTS, 9.314 N in model with 12 composite function PTS. The
      relative displacement of the tibia and femur was 0.276 mm in model with 2
      composite function PTS, 0.577 mm in model with 7 composite function PTS, 0.602 mm
      in model with 12 composite function PTS. CONCLUSION: The steeper PTS may be a
      risk factor in ACL injury.

TI  - Clinical significance of CD81 expression by clonal plasma cells in high-risk
      smoldering and symptomatic multiple myeloma patients.

AB  - The presence of CD19 in myelomatous plasma cells (MM-PCs) correlates with adverse
      prognosis in multiple myeloma (MM). Although CD19 expression is upregulated by
      CD81, this marker has been poorly investigated and its prognostic value in MM
      remains unknown. We have analyzed CD81 expression by multiparameter flow
      cytometry in MM-PCs from 230 MM patients at diagnosis included in the Grupo
      Espanol de Mieloma (GEM)05>65 years trial as well as 56 high-risk smoldering MM
      (SMM). CD81 expression was detected in 45% (103/230) MM patients, and the
      detection of CD81(+) MM-PC was an independent prognostic factor for
      progression-free (hazard ratio=1.9; P=0.003) and overall survival (hazard
      ratio=2.0; P=0.02); this adverse impact was validated in an additional series of 
      325 transplant-candidate MM patients included in the GEM05 <65 years trial.
      Moreover, CD81(+) SMM (n=34/56, 57%) patients had a shorter time to progression
      to MM (P=0.02). Overall, our results show that CD81 may have a relevant role in
      MM pathogenesis and represent a novel adverse prognostic marker in myeloma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of embryo replacement depth on IVF and
      embryo transfer outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis (May 2005 to November
      2008) of 5,055 ultrasound-guided embryo transfers belonging to 3,930 infertile
      couples. The distance between the fundal endometrial surface and the catheter tip
      was measured and accordingly, patients were divided into five groups. SETTING:
      Anatolia IVF Center, Ankara, Turkey. PATIENT(S): All patients enrolled in the IVF
      program undergoing embryo transfer. INTERVENTION(S): No patient received any
      additional procedure or intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy
      rate (PR) and ongoing PR. RESULT(S): Mean total number of embryos transferred in 
      groups 4 and 5 were significantly higher than in groups 2 and 3. Analysis of PRs 
      and outcome of gestations in the five groups studied yielded similar PRs in all
      groups except for group 1. CONCLUSION(S): Pregnancy rates and ongoing PRs are
      higher if the embryos are replaced at a distance >10 mm from the fundal
      endometrial surface. In addition because significantly more embryos were replaced
      in cycles where the transfers occurred at a distance of >20 mm, a distance>10 mm 
      to <20 mm seems to be the best site for embryo transfer to achieve higher PRs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high mortality 
      when initial treatment fails. Early identification of these patients allows
      physicians to modify treatments earlier, increasing survival. METHODS: Ninety-one
      hospitalized patients with CAP were studied. Serum soluble ST2 levels were
      measured at diagnosis and at 3, 7, and 14 days (days 0, 3, 7, and 14) after the
      initiation of antimicrobial treatment. The predictive value of all-cause
      in-hospital mortality and the additive effect of soluble ST2 on the pneumonia
      severity index (PSI) were evaluated. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, high serum 
      levels of soluble ST2 at days 0, 3, 7, and 14 were predictive of death (hazard
      ratios: 3.1, 10.0, 12.0, and 22.6, respectively). In multivariate analysis, a
      combination of soluble ST2 at day 3 (above 2700 pg/ml) and PSI were predictive of
      death with higher accuracy than PSI alone (net reclassification improvement,
      0.44; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.17; P = 0.001 for both).
      Specifically, simultaneous presence of high soluble ST2 (day 3) and a PSI of 5
      was suggestive of higher mortality risk than a PSI of 5 alone (mortality 78% vs. 
      39%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Soluble ST2 is prognostic indicator of CAP and
      can add to the predictive value of the PSI.

AB  - Several studies report the effects of excessive use of sugars and sweeteners in
      the diet. These include obesity, cardiac diseases, diabetes, and even lymphomas, 
      leukemias, cancers of the bladder and brain, chronic fatigue syndrome,
      Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism, and
      systemic lupus. On the other hand, each sugar and sweetener has a distinct
      metabolic assimilation process, and its chemical structure plays an important
      role in this process. Several scientific papers present the biological effects of
      the sugars and sweeteners in relation to their chemical structure. One important 
      issue dealing with the sugars is the degree of similarity in their structures,
      focusing mostly on optical isomerism. Finding and developing new sugars and
      sweeteners with desired properties is an emerging research area, in which in
      silico approaches play an important role.

TI  - Survival outcomes for advanced kidney cancer patients in the era of targeted
      therapies.
PG  - 165
LID - 10.21037/atm.2018.04.44 [doi]
AB  - Background: Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) results in over 14,000 deaths
      each year in the United States alone. The therapeutic landscape for advanced RCC 
      changed dramatically with the approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
      between 2006 and 2012. A large-scale analysis of survival trends has not been
      performed in the TKI era to determine their impact on outcomes for advanced RCC
      patients. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) database
      was queried for adult patients with advanced RCC diagnosed between 2000 and 2013.
      Patients were divided into two cohorts based on the year of diagnosis-pre-TKI
      cohort [2000-2006] and TKI cohort [2007-2013]. Kaplan-Meier survival and
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed. Results: A total
      of 14,976 patients were included in our study. Median age at diagnosis was 64
      years (range, 18-89 years). Median (cancer-specific) overall survival was 10.0
      months in the TKI cohort compared with 8.0 months in the pre-TKI cohort,
      corresponding to a 13% improvement in survival in the TKI area [hazard ratio (HR)
      for death 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84-0.91, P<0.0001]. Median
      survival was improved by 2 months for patients with clear-cell RCC histology [HR 
      for death 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.91, P<0.0001]. Patients with non-clear cell RCC
      had a 25% higher risk of mortality compared with those with clear-cell RCC.
      Additionally, median survival for non-clear cell RCC patients was not
      statistically different between the two cohorts (HR for death 0.98; 95% CI,
      0.88-1.09, P=0.714). Subgroup analysis showed that elderly patients (age 71 years
      and above) had a 45% higher risk of death from advanced RCC compared with young
      patients (aged 18-50 years) [HR for death 1.45; 95% CI, 1.36-1.54, P<0.0001].
      Gender and racial disparities in outcomes were also noted with women having a 10%
      higher risk of death compared with men (HR for death 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06-1.14,
      P<0.001) and Black patients having a 15% higher risk of death compared with White
      patients (HR for death 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08-1.23, P<0.0001). Conclusions: Our study
      provides a largest registry-based analysis of survival outcomes in the TKI era.
      In majority of patients, the survival has improved significantly with the advent 
      of TKIs as standard of care therapy. Survival for patients with non-clear cell
      RCC is clearly worse than clear-cell RCC and does not appear to have changed with
      TKIs. Elderly patients, women, and Black patients appear to have worse outcomes
      and these disparities merit further investigation.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral variables mediate the impact of violent loss on post-loss
      psychopathology.
PG  - 382-90
LID - 10.1037/tra0000018 [doi]
AB  - Research has shown that violent losses lead to more severe emotional distress
      than do nonviolent losses. Little is known about the psychological mechanisms
      underlying the debilitating impact of violent loss. In the current study, the
      authors used self-reported data of 496 bereaved individuals, bereaved in the last
      3 years, to examine the role of seven cognitive-behavioral variables in mediating
      the impact of violent loss: (a) a sense of "unrealness" about the irreversibility
      of the separation, negative cognitions about (b) the self, (c) life, (d) the
      future, and (e) catastrophic misinterpretations of grief-reactions, and indices
      of (f) anxious avoidance and (g) depressive avoidance behavior. Outcomes showed
      that people bereaved by violent losses (due to homicide, suicide, or accident)
      had significantly higher symptom-levels of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD),
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression than persons bereaved by
      nonviolent losses. Indices of unrealness, negative cognitions about the self, the
      future, catastrophic misinterpretations, and depressive avoidance were all
      significant independent mediators of the linkages between violent loss and
      symptom-levels of PGD and depression. Negative cognitions about the future,
      catastrophic misinterpretations, and depressive and anxious avoidance emerged as 
      unique mediators of the association between violent loss and elevated PTSD
      severity. Findings underscore that cognitive-behavioral variables are a critical 
      component of elevated emotional distress following violent loss.

TI  - Nebulization of Cyclic Arginine-Glycine-(D)-Aspartic Acid-Peptide Grafted and
      Drug Encapsulated Liposomes for Inhibition of Acute Lung Injury.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1007/s11095-018-2366-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a fatal syndrome in critically ill patients. 
      It is characterized by lung edema and inflammation. Numerous pro-inflammatory
      mediators are released into alveoli. Among them, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)
      causes an increase in solute permeability across the alveolar-capillary barrier
      leading to edema. It activates key effector cells (alveolar epithelial and
      endothelial cells) releasing inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. The purpose
      of the study was to demonstrate that nebulized liposomes inhibit ALI in vivo.
      METHODS: In vivo ALI model was simulated through intra-tracheal instillation of
      IL-1beta solution (100 mug/mL in PBS, pH 7.2, 200 muL) in male Sprague-Dawley
      rats. Various formulations were tested in ALI induced rats. These formulations
      include plain liposomes (PL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate solution (MPS
      solution), cRGD-peptide grafted liposomes (L(cRGD)) and methylprednisolone sodium
      succinate encapsulated and cRGD-peptide grafted liposomes (MPS-L(cRGD)).
      Formulations were nebulized in vivo in rats using micro-pump nebulizer. RESULTS: 
      Liposome formulations exhibited higher levels of drug concentration in lungs. The
      physicochemical parameters demonstrated that the liposome formulations were
      stable. On the basis of aerodynamic droplet-size, nebulized formulations were
      estimated to deposit in different regions of respiratory tract, especially
      alveolar region, Among the formulations, MPS-L(cRGD) caused significant reduction
      of edema, neutrophil infiltration and inflammation biochemical marker levels.
      CONCLUSION: From the results, it can be inferred that nebulization of targeted
      liposomes had facilitated spatial and temporal modulation of drug delivery
      resulting in alleviation of ALI.

TI  - Serotonin transporter occupancy of high-dose selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors during major depressive disorder measured with [11C]DASB positron
      emission tomography.
PG  - 539-45
AB  - RATIONALE: Previous work has shown 80% serotonin transporter (5-HTT) occupancy to
      be a consistent finding at the minimum therapeutic dose during selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment.
      [(11)C]N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine positron emission
      tomography ([(11)C]DASB PET) is currently the best method available to quantify
      5-HTT occupancy in humans. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to
      determine 5-HTT occupancy during high dose SSRI treatment using [(11)C]DASB PET. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects and 12 subjects with major
      depressive disorder completed the protocol. Depressed subjects received one
      [(11)C]DASB PET scan after a minimum of 4 weeks treatment at high doses of
      venlafaxine, sertraline, or citalopram. Baseline 5-HTT binding potential (BP) was
      taken as the average 5-HTT BP of the 12 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Mean striatal 
      5-HTT occupancy for each antidepressant group was approximately 85% at high
      therapeutic dose. This was significantly greater than 80% (one-sample t test; p <
      0.04, venlafaxine group; p < 0.02, sertraline group; p < 0.01, citalopram group) 
      for each high dose antidepressant group. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly greater 5-HTT
      blockade at high dose provides a rationale for raising the dose from the minimum 
      therapeutic dose in specific clinical circumstances. It is likely that 15%
      unoccupied 5-HTT remains, which should be addressed in future drug development.

      marked; in the contralateral testis, germ cell apoptosis increased after 6 hours 
      of reperfusion, achieved statistical significance after 24 hours, and decreased
      after 72 hours of reperfusion and was initiated by decreased bcl-2 messenger RNA 
      levels and elevated bax/bcl-2 ratio within the first 6 hours of reperfusion.

TI  - Debating the legitimacy of a contested environmental illness: a case study of
      multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS).
PG  - 1026-40
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-9566.2010.01255.x [doi]
AB  - More than 20years after it was first identified, the anomalous condition,
      multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS), remains immersed in controversy, with a
      continuing debate over its causation being played out in the medico-scientific
      community and in the courts. This article examines why sceptical and supportive
      experts disagree over the condition's legitimacy as an organic condition. Drawing
      on ethnographic research conducted in Perth, Western Australia, the author
      scrutinises the decision-making practices of 16 experts (eight sceptical and
      eight supportive of a chemical explanation). Both groups were found to use
      evidence-based, inductive reasoning. However, sceptical experts tended to use a
      different set of evidence requirements, exhibited more faith in the efficiency of
      the current biomedical paradigm regarding toxicity and were less likely to
      acknowledge uncertainty in their field. All the experts recognised a spectrum of 
      beliefs about the causal mechanisms of MCS. However, when they were engaged in
      litigation as expert witnesses due to their supportive or sceptical tendency, the
      oppositional legal system polarised their opinions and exacerbated the perceived 
      divide between them. Ultimately, the adversarial medico-legal process inhibits
      genuine dialogue between some of the key players in the MCS debate, thus impeding
      understanding and consensus about the condition.

AB  - We have investigated the Ce 4f electronic states in the Ce-doped manganites
      Nd(0.45-x)Ce(x)Sr0.55MnO3 (NCSMO) by means of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
      and hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). The Ce 3d XAS shows that the 
      Ce ions exist in the form of the Ce(3+) and Ce(4+) mixed-valent states, and we
      have found that the XAS spectral features change with temperature. The Ce 3d XAS 
      and HAXPES spectra for NCSMO agree reasonably well with calculated results based 
      on the single-impurity Anderson model, which takes into account the atomic
      multiplets and two valence bands. The estimated Ce bulk valence of
      Nd0.15Ce0.3Sr0.55MnO3 decreases from 3.44 to 3.30 with cooling.

TI  - Insights into the enzyme-substrate interaction in the norovirus 3C-like protease.
PG  - 509-21
LID - 10.1093/jb/mvp094 [doi]
AB  - The Glu54 residue of the norovirus 3C-like protease was implicated in proteolysis
      as a third-member carboxylate of the catalytic triad. The E54L mutant protease
      cleaved the sequence (133)LSFE/AP between the 3B and 3C regions of norovirus
      polyprotein, but did not cleave the sequence (198)ATSE/GK between the 3A and 3B. 
      The 3BC junction mutation (3B-L133A or 3B-F135S) hampered the cleavage by the
      E54L protease, whereas the 3AB junction mutation (3A-A198L, S200F) allowed the
      E54L protease to digest. These results indicate that the E54L mutant protease is 
      a substrate-specificity mutant and requires large hydrophobic amino acid residues
      at both P4 and P2 positions of the substrate. It was notable that the 3A-S200F P2
      position mutation caused tight interaction between the wild-type protease and the
      C-terminus of the 3A protein, hence a decreased release rate of the product from 
      the enzyme. This tight binding was dependent on the hydrophobicity of amino acid 
      residues introduced at position 200 of the 3A region and was affected by the
      mutation in the bII-cII loop of the protease or the mutation of position 198 of
      3A corresponding to the P4 position of the substrate. These results suggest that 
      the protease and the substrate sense each other in the process of the
      proteolysis, being supported by crystal structures.

TI  - Use of treatment guidelines in clinical decision making in bipolar disorder: a
      pilot survey of clinicians.
PG  - 467-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With recent attention to the importance of evidence-based medicine in 
      psychiatry, a number of treatment guidelines have emerged to aid clinicians in
      clinical decision making. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to
      which such guidelines are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. METHODS: In 
      November 2005, self-administered questionnaires were sent to 7000 psychiatrists
      who treat bipolar disorder in their clinical practice. An additional mailing of
      these questionnaires was done in January 2006 to a different group of 7000
      psychiatrists who also treat bipolar disorder in their clinical practice. The
      first 312 completed surveys were analyzed. Eight questions relevant to clinical
      usage of, and attitudes toward, existing guidelines were asked. RESULTS: Among
      the 312 respondents, 64.1% reported making routine use of treatment guidelines
      when making clinical decisions, including 19.6% who used the American Psychiatric
      Association treatment guidelines and 33.0% who used all published guidelines. Of 
      those who did not use bipolar guidelines, the most frequently cited reason given 
      by respondents (20.1%) was that such guidelines do not address particular
      features of their clinical populations. Among the different types of practice,
      private individual practice gave this answer most frequently (27.5%).
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite considerable efforts to develop 
      and disseminate evidence-based guidelines, they are not widely implemented and
      substantial opportunities exist to educate clinicians about their value and
      relevance. Limitations of the study include a low response rate and possible
      selection bias. Nonetheless, this project was conceived of as a pilot study and
      these limitations do not negate the findings, but suggest other avenues for
      investigation.

TI  - Infrared photodissociation of (NO)n + x X cluster ions (n < or = 5).
PG  - 998-1004
AB  - Measurements of the infrared photodissociation pathways and spectra of
      size-selected (NO)n +X complexes, for n in the range 2-5, have been carried out
      using a line-tuneable CO laser (photon energy 1600-1800 cm(-1)). X is one of Ar, 
      Kr, Xe, O2, CO2, CH3Cl, CF4 or SF6. Two photoinduced fragmentation pathways have 
      been monitored as a function of radiation wavelength: the loss of NO and the loss
      of X. The photofragmentation patterns and branching ratios are influenced by two 
      factors: (i) the value of n; and to a lesser degree, (ii) the nature of the
      atom/molecule, X. A limited number of IR spectra have been recorded for the
      dimer, (NO)2+, in association with the rare gas atoms and CF4; for the remaining 
      examples, the trimer, (NO)3+, appears to act as a stable core with a
      comparatively large infrared absorption cross-section at ca. 1720 cm(-1).

TI  - Predicting change: Approximate inference under explicit representation of
      temporal structure in changing environments.
PG  - e1006707
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006707 [doi]
AB  - In our daily lives timing of our actions plays an essential role when we navigate
      the complex everyday environment. It is an open question though how the
      representations of the temporal structure of the world influence our behavior.
      Here we propose a probabilistic model with an explicit representation of state
      durations which may provide novel insights in how the brain predicts upcoming
      changes. We illustrate several properties of the behavioral model using a
      standard reversal learning design and compare its task performance to standard
      reinforcement learning models. Furthermore, using experimental data, we
      demonstrate how the model can be applied to identify participants' beliefs about 
      the latent temporal task structure. We found that roughly one quarter of
      participants seem to have learned the latent temporal structure and used it to
      anticipate changes, whereas the remaining participants' behavior did not show
      signs of anticipatory responses, suggesting a lack of precise temporal
      expectations. We expect that the introduced behavioral model will allow, in
      future studies, for a systematic investigation of how participants learn the
      underlying temporal structure of task environments and how these representations 
      shape behavior.

PG  - 83-7
LID - 10.1159/000271955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze various 'family history'
      variables (i.e. childhood health, financial situation while growing up, living
      with grandparents before age 17, and number of children) among participants of
      the Georgia Centenarian Study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether family history
      variables predict critical outcome areas such as cognitive functioning,
      activities of daily living, mental health, and economic dependence. METHODS: A
      total of 318 older adults (236 centenarians and 82 octogenarians) were assessed
      with regard to their mental status, ADL (activities of daily living) functioning,
      depression, family history, loneliness, and perceived economic status. RESULTS:
      Analyses indicated that the number of children significantly predicted the
      ability to engage in activities of daily living and loneliness. In essence, the
      more children, the higher the activities of the daily living score and the lower 
      the loneliness scores. In addition, childhood health significantly predicted
      loneliness. The poorer one's health in childhood, the higher the loneliness
      scores. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm the importance of distal
      family history variables on present-day functioning.

TI  - Multiscale modeling of biological pattern formation.
PG  - 435-60
AB  - In the past few decades, it has become increasingly popular and important to
      utilize mathematical models to understand how microscopic intercellular
      interactions lead to the macroscopic pattern formation ubiquitous in the
      biological world. Modeling methodologies come in a large variety and presently it
      is unclear what is their interrelationship and the assumptions implicit in their 
      use. They can be broadly divided into three categories according to the spatial
      scale they purport to describe: the molecular, the cellular and the tissue
      scales. Most models address dynamics at the tissue-scale, few address the
      cellular scale and very few address the molecular scale. Of course there would be
      no dissent between models or at least the underlying assumptions would be known
      if they were all rigorously derived from a molecular level model, in which case
      the laws of physics and chemistry are very well known. However in practice this
      is not possible due to the immense complexity of the problem. A simpler approach 
      is to derive models at a coarse scale from an intermediate scale model which has 
      the special property of being based on biology and physics which are
      experimentally well studied. In this article we use such an approach to
      understand the assumptions inherent in the use of the most popular models, the
      tissue-level ones. Such models are found to invariably rely on the hidden
      assumption that statistical correlations between cells can be neglected. This
      often means that the predictions of these models are qualitatively correct but
      may fail in spatial regions where cell concentration is small, particularly if
      there are strong long-range correlations in cell movement. Such behavior can only
      be properly taken into account by cellular models. However such models unlike the
      tissue-level models are frequently not easily amenable to analysis, except when
      the number of interacting cells is small or when the interactions are weak, and
      thus are rather more suited for simulation. Hence it is our conclusion that the
      simultaneous theoretical and numerical analysis of models of the same biological 
      system at different spatial scales provides a more robust method of understanding
      biological systems than the utilization of a single scale model. In particular
      this enables one to clearly separate nonphysical predictions stemming from model

TI  - Identification of mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance in the
      para-type sodium channel of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis.
PG  - 1305-13
AB  - Knockdown resistance (kdr) to pyrethroid insecticides is caused by point
      mutations in the pyrethroid target site, the para-type sodium channel of nerve
      membranes. This most commonly involves alterations within the domain II (S4-S6)
      region of the channel protein where five different mutation sites have been
      identified across a range of insect species. To investigate the incidence of this
      mechanism in cat fleas, we have cloned and sequenced the IIS4-IIS6 region of the 
      para sodium channel gene from seven laboratory flea strains. Analysis of these
      sequences revealed two amino acid replacements at residues previously implicated 
      in pyrethroid resistance. One is the 'common' kdr mutation, a leucine to
      phenylalanine substitution (equivalent to L1014F of housefly) reported previously
      in several other insects. The other is a threonine to valine substitution
      (equivalent to T929V) and is a novel variant of the T929I mutation first
      identified in diamondback moth. The L1014F mutation was found at varying
      frequency in all of the laboratory flea strains, whereas the T929V mutation was
      found only in the highly resistant Cottontail strain. We have developed rapid
      PCR-based diagnostic assays for the detection of these mutations in individual
      cat fleas and used them to show that both L1014F and T929V are common in UK and
      US flea populations. This survey revealed a significant number of fleas that
      carry only the V929 allele indicating that co-expression with the F1014 allele is
      not necessary for flea viability.

TI  - Microsatellite analysis of allelic imbalance in tumour and blood from patients
      with prostate cancer.
PG  - 253-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.07600.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a high frequency of allelic imbalance (AI) is
      associated with clinicopathological variables of patients with prostate cancer.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite
      (MS) instability (MSI) on circulating plasma DNA in a polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR)-based MS study of 230 patients with prostate cancer and 43 with benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) using a panel of 13 polymorphic MS markers. RESULTS: 
      The overall incidence of AI was significantly higher in primary tumours (34%)
      than in blood plasma samples from patients with prostate cancer (11%). Although
      LOH (2.0%) and MSI (1.5%) were also found in BPH plasma samples, their
      frequencies were low. AI identified in plasma samples from patients with prostate
      cancer could be retrieved in 63% of the paired tumour samples. The highest
      concordance of AI and retention of heterozygosity between tumour and plasma
      samples was 83% at the marker D8S360. There were high frequencies of LOH at the
      markers THRB, D7S522 and D8S137 in both types of specimens. The markers D11S898
      and D11S1313 on the chromosome arm 11q showed frequent MSI. The comparison with
      established risk factors showed significant associations of an increase in
      prostate volume with AI at the combined markers D6S474/D7S522 in tumour tissues
      and at D7S522 in plasma samples (P < 0.04). In the primary tumours there was a
      further correlation of LOH at D11S1313 with increasing tPSA value (P = 0.005).
      The combination of total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and % free PSA was
      associated with LOH at THRB in plasma samples. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma-based MS
      analysis may have clinical value for the molecular staging of prostate cancer.

AB  - To overcome the speed limitation of conventional optical tomography, a temporal
      imaging technique has been integrated with optical time-domain reflectometry to
      realize ultrafast temporally magnified (TM) tomography. In this Letter, the
      sensitivity of TM tomography has been further enhanced using optical parametric
      amplification and distributed Raman amplification, and this technique is named
      temporally encoded amplified and magnified (TEAM) tomography. As a result, a
      78-dB sensitivity has been realized, comparable to ultrafast optical coherence
      tomography systems. In addition, an 86.7-mum axial resolution can be realized
      across a 67.5-mm imaging range. To demonstrate the significance of sensitivity
      improvement, tomographic imaging of a centimeter-thick phantom is provided at an 
      A-scan rate of 44 MHz.

TI  - An intentional vocalization draws others' attention: a playback experiment with
      wild chimpanzees.
PG  - 581-91
LID - 10.1007/s10071-014-0827-z [doi]
AB  - A vital step in the evolution of language is likely to have been when signalers
      explicitly intended to direct recipients' attention to external objects with the 
      use of referential signals. Although animal signals can direct the attention of
      others to external events, such as in monkey predator alarm calls, there is
      little evidence that this is the result of an intention to inform the recipient. 
      Two recent studies, however, indicate that the production of chimpanzee quiet
      alarm calls, given to snakes, complies with some standard behavioral markers of
      intentional signaling, such as gaze alternation. But it is currently unknown
      whether the calls alone direct receivers' attention to the threat. To address
      this, we carried out a playback experiment with free-ranging chimpanzees in
      Budongo Forest, Uganda, using a within-subjects design. From a hidden speaker, we
      broadcast either quiet alarm 'hoos' ('alert hoos') or acoustically
      distinguishable hoos produced while resting ('rest hoos') and found a significant
      increase in search behavior after 'alert' compared with 'rest' hoos, with
      subjects monitoring either the call provider or the area near the call provider. 
      In sum, chimpanzee 'alert hoos' represent a plausible case of an intentionally
      produced animal vocalization (other studies) that refers recipients to signalers 
      and/or to an external event (this study).

TI  - Analysis of SEMA6B gene expression in breast cancer: identification of a new
      isoform.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SEMA6B is a member of the semaphorins axon-guidance family. A growing
      body of evidence has been accumulated describing the role of semaphorin molecules
      in cancer development and the involvement of SEMA6B in cancer progression has
      recently been proposed. METHODS: Our analysis, based on real-time PCR, focused on
      the expression of SEMA6B in a panel of breast cancer tissues, compared to the
      normal counterpart. RESULTS: In cancer tissues we found a significantly strong
      down-modulation of this transcript. Moreover we identified and characterized a
      novel SEMA6B isoform, named SEMA6Ba. This isoform has a novel splice junction,
      created by the usage of alternative donor and acceptor splice sites internal to
      the exon 17. By in silico analysis we found that the new transcript 3' UTR lacks 
      some highly-conserved miRNA binding sites, suggesting possible consequences on
      both spatial and temporal expression of SEMA6Ba. The translated sequence of
      SEMA6Ba lacks the cytoplasmic tail, crucial for triggering the reverse signaling 
      described for the transmembrane semaphorins. We also demonstrated, by
      immunofluorescence analysis of endogenous and overexpressed SEMA6Ba, that the
      protein clearly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. In
      conclusion, SEMA6B gene products are strongly down modulated in breast cancer
      tissues and a new isoform named SEMA6Ba has been described and characterized.
      GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our work states a clear relation among breast cancer and
      SEMA6B expression; moreover we describe for the first time the SEMA6Ba protein
      and report here the analysis of SEMA6Ba RNA messenger, the protein expression and
      the cellular localization.

AB  - The mitochondrion is a complex organelle that serves essential roles in energy
      transduction, ATP production, and a myriad of cellular signaling events. A finely
      tuned regulatory network orchestrates the biogenesis, maintenance, and turnover
      of mitochondria. The high-capacity mitochondrial system in the heart is regulated
      in a dynamic way to generate and consume enormous amounts of ATP in order to
      support the constant pumping function in the context of changing energy demands. 
      This review describes the regulatory circuitry and downstream events involved in 
      mitochondrial biogenesis and its coordination with mitochondrial dynamics in
      developing and diseased hearts.

AB  - We have identified an analog of SspB, the proteolytic adaptor for
      transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA)-tagged proteins, in Caulobacter crescentus. C.
      crescentus SspB shares limited sequence similarity with Escherichia coli SspB but
      binds the tmRNA tag in vitro and is required for optimal proteolysis of tagged
      proteins in vivo.

PG  - 825-34
LID - 10.1007/s00113-016-0242-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous internal fixation of pelvic fractures is increasing in
      popularity with multiple new techniques reported. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this
      article is to outline the imaging, indication, planning, equipment, surgical
      technique and complications of these methods. METHODS: A review of the literature
      is provided and the techniques for anterior and posterior pelvic stabilization
      are discussed. RESULTS: High-quality preoperative CT scans are essential in
      planning for this technique. The anterior internal fixator ("InFix") is an
      effective method for stabilizing the anterior ring and should be usually used in 
      conjunction with posterior fixation. Good technique avoids neurovascular injury, 
      which can be a devastating complication. The retrograde anterior column screw
      (RACS) is a technique that can be used in most patients, although in smaller
      patients smaller screw diameters may be needed. The entry point for the screw is 
      more lateral in women than men. Iliosacral screws (ISS) are an effective method
      of posterior stabilization and can be placed using 2D or 3D fluoroscopy, computer
      navigation or CT navigation. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous fixation of pelvic
      fractures requires high-quality imaging and can be aided by computer navigation. 
      Safe techniques are reproducible; however, not all patients and fracture patterns
      can be treated using these techniques.

AB  - Oral mucositis is a painful inflammation of mucous membranes commonly after
      chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to develop mucoadhesive
      nanofibers containing glutamine via electrospinning and to characterize them for 
      the treatment of oral mucositis. Different mucoadhesive polymers were tried for
      preparing nanofibers and sodium alginate nanofibers were chosen after the
      characterization studies. Glutamine-loaded nanofibers were produced and
      characterized. Glutamine loaded onto nanofibers was confirmed by differantial
      scanning calorimetry and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. As a
      result, scanning electron microscopy observations showed that the glutamine
      loaded nanofibers had average diameter of 160nm. Glutamine amount was found to be
      0.452mg/cm(2). Work of mucoadhesion, tensile strength and elongation at break
      values of the glutamine loaded nanofibers were found to be 0.165mJ/cm(2), 2.61mPa
      and 6.62% respectively. In vitro dissolution tests showed that more than 85% of
      the drug was diffused from the nanofibers at the end of 4h. Stability studies
      showed that there was no significant changes at 4 and 25 degrees C/65% relative
      humidity storage conditions. Therefore, these results demonstrate that glutamine 
      loaded nanofibers could have potential as an oromucosal drug delivery system for 
      the treatment oral mucositis.

TI  - Enhancement of 5-aminolevulinate production with recombinant Escherichia coli
      using batch and fed-batch culture system.
PG  - 4864-70
AB  - 5-Aminolevulinate (ALA) production with recombinant Escherichia coli Rosetta
      (DE3)/pET28a(+)-hemA was studied. In batch fermentation, the addition of glucose 
      and glycine was effective to improve ALA production. Then the fed-batch
      fermentation was conducted with continuous feeding of precursors. When the
      concentrations of succinic acid and glycine were 7.0 g/l and 4.0 g/l,
      respectively, in the feeding, the ALA yield reached 4.1g/l. But the molar yield
      (ALA/glycine) was decreased in the fed-batch fermentation compared to batch
      fermentation. And it was found that the pH control during fed-batch cultivation
      was very important for the cell growth and ALA production. A two-stage pH value
      controlling strategy was suggested, in which, the pH value in the first 6h was
      regulated at pH 5.9, after then at pH 6.2, and the ALA yield was as high as
      6.6g/l via fed-batch fermentation.

TI  - Longitudinal relationships among visual acuity, daily functional status, and
      mortality: the Salisbury Eye Evaluation Study.
PG  - 1400-6
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2014.2847 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Determination of the mechanisms by which visual loss increases
      mortality risk is important for developing interventional strategies. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the direct and indirect effects of loss of visual acuity (VA) on
      mortality risk through functional status changes among aging adults. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective longitudinal study of a population-based
      sample of 2520 noninstitutionalized adults aged 65 to 84 years from September 16,
      1993, through July 26, 2003, in the greater Salisbury area of Maryland.
      Participants underwent reassessment 2, 6, and 8 years after baseline. Mortality
      status was ascertained from linkage with the National Death Index through 2009.
      EXPOSURES: Results of VA testing and self-reported functional status based on
      activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURE: Mortality. RESULTS: Worse VA levels at baseline were associated with an 
      increased the risk for mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16 [95% CI, 1.04-1.28]; P 
      < .01) through their effect on lower IADL levels at baseline. Declines in VA over
      time were associated with increased mortality risk (HR, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.27-2.51];
      P < .001) by way of decreasing IADL levels over time. Participants experiencing
      the mean linear decline in VA of 1 letter on the Early Treatment Diabetic
      Retinopathy Study acuity chart per year are expected to have a 16% increase in
      mortality risk during the 8-year study exclusively through associated declines in
      IADL levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this longitudinal study of older
      adults, VA loss adversely affected IADL levels, which subsequently increased the 
      risk for mortality. Prevention of disabling ocular conditions, treatment of
      correctable visual impairment, and interventions designed to prevent the effect
      of visual impairment on IADL declines may all reduce mortality risk in aging
      adults.

LID - 10.1007/7651_2014_178 [doi]
AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)
      can differentiate to cardiomyocytes in vitro, offering unique opportunities to
      investigate cardiac development and disease as well as providing a platform to
      perform drug and toxicity tests. Initial cardiac differentiation methods were
      based on either inductive co-culture or aggregation as embryoid bodies, often in 
      the presence of fetal calf serum. More recently, monolayer differentiation
      protocols have evolved as feasible alternatives and are often performed in
      completely defined culture medium and substrates. Thus, our ability to
      efficiently and reproducibly generate cardiomyocytes from multiple different hESC
      and hiPSC lines has improved significantly.We have developed a directed
      differentiation monolayer protocol that can be used to generate cultures
      comprising ~50% cardiomyocytes, in which both the culture of the undifferentiated
      human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and the differentiation procedure itself are
      defined and serum-free. The differentiation method is also effective for hPSCs
      maintained in other culture systems. In this chapter, we outline the
      differentiation protocol and describe methods to assess cardiac differentiation
      efficiency as well as to identify and quantify the yield of cardiomyocytes.

TI  - Oncology Patient Interest in the Use of New Technologies to Manage Their Disease:
      Cross-Sectional Survey.
PG  - e11006
LID - 10.2196/11006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information and communication technologies (ICTs) in oncology can
      revolutionize the medical care of cancer patients. ICTs can promote patients'
      empowerment and real-time disease monitoring. There is limited information about 
      the impact of ICTs in cancer patients or their level of interest in using these
      tools for greater management of their condition. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
      understand the ICT usage profile in hematology-oncology patients to identify
      their needs and determine their level of interest in these technologies as a
      means of managing their disease. METHODS: A 28-item questionnaire was drawn up by
      a multidisciplinary team including pharmacists and oncologists. The questions
      were organized into 3 blocks, which were as follows: block A-sociodemographic
      characteristics; block B-use of ICTs when searching for health-related
      information; and block C-usage preferences for health apps. Hematology-oncology
      patients receiving treatment between May and July 2017 were included. A paper
      copy of the questionnaire was handed over to patients in either the day hospital 
      or the pharmaceutical care consultancy in pharmacy services. RESULTS: A total of 
      650 questionnaires were handed out, with a participation of 94.0% (611/650).
      Patient sociodemographic characteristics were as follows: mean age was 57.8 years
      (age range: 19-91). Of 611 participants, 40.7% (249/611) had a university
      education, and 45.1% (276/611) of participants reported their overall state of
      health to be good. Results from use of ICTs when searching for health-related
      information were as follows: 87.1% (532/611) of participants were interested in
      being informed about health-related matters. Of all participants, 75.5% (532/611)
      sought information from health professionals and 61.3% (375/611) on the internet.
      Before going to their doctor's appointment, 21.8% (133/611) of patients looked up
      information about their disease or treatment on the internet. This access to the 
      internet rose to 50.9% (311/611) after their first medical appointment with their
      oncologist. Usage preferences for health apps were as follows: 82.7% (505/611)
      had a smartphone, whereas 20.3% (124/611) had a health app installed. Overall,
      81.5% (498/611) would use an app if their health professional recommended it to
      them, but 39.6% (242/611) were not willing to pay for it. CONCLUSIONS: The
      hematology-oncology patients showed a great deal of interest in searching for
      health-related information by means of ICTs, especially using smartphones and
      apps. The issues that drew the most interest in terms of apps were appointment
      management, advice on disease management, and communication with health
      professionals. Free access to these features and the recommendation by a health
      professional are important factors when it comes to their use. Therefore, the
      health care provider is a key element in the recommendation of ICTs, providing
      their knowledge and experience concerning their correct usage.

TI  - Measuring care trajectories using health administrative databases: a
      population-based investigation of transitions from emergency to acute care.
PG  - 565
AB  - BACKGROUND: A patient's trajectory through the healthcare system affects resource
      use and outcomes. Data fields in population-based administrative health databases
      are potentially valuable resources for constructing care trajectories for entire 
      populations, provided they can capture patient transitions between healthcare
      services. This study describes patient transitions from the emergency department 
      (ED) to other healthcare settings, and ascertains whether the discharge
      disposition field recorded in the ED data was a reliable source of patient
      transition information from the emergency to the acute care settings. METHODS:
      Administrative health databases from the province of Saskatchewan, Canada
      (population 1.1 million) were used to identify patients with at least one ED
      visit to provincial teaching hospitals (n = 5) between April 1, 2006 and March
      31, 2012. Discharge disposition from ED was described using frequencies and
      percentages; and it includes categories such as home, transfer to other
      facilities, and died. The kappa statistic with 95 % confidence intervals (95 %
      CIs) was used to measure agreement between the discharge disposition field in the
      ED data and hospital admission records. RESULTS: We identified N = 1,062,861
      visits for 371,480 patients to EDs over the six-year study period. Three-quarters
      of the discharges were to home, 16.1 % were to acute care in the same facility in
      which the ED was located, and 1.6 % resulted in a patient transfer to a different
      acute care facility. Agreement between the discharge disposition field in the ED 
      data and hospital admission records was good when the emergency and acute care
      departments were in the same facility (kappa = 0.77, 95 % CI 0.77, 0.77). For
      transfers to a different acute care facility, agreement was only fair (kappa =
      0.36, 95 % CI 0.35, 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who attended EDs
      did not transition to another healthcare setting. For those who transitioned to
      acute care, accuracy of the discharge disposition field depended on whether the
      two services were provided in the same facility. Using the hospital data as
      reference, we conclude that the discharge disposition field in the ED data is not
      reliable for measuring transitions from ED to acute care.

TI  - Direct and indirect high-performance liquid chromatography enantioseparation of
      trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid.
PG  - 305-11
AB  - trans-4-Hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid (HNEA) is a marker of lipid peroxidation
      resulting from the metabolism of trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). Direct and
      indirect RP-HPLC methods for the separation of HNEA enantiomers were developed
      and compared. The indirect method involved pre-column derivatization with a
      chiral amino agent, (1S,2S)-(+)-2-amino-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3-propanediol, and
      subsequent separation of diastereomers on a Spherisorb ODS2 column. The direct
      separation of HNEA enantiomers was performed using the chiral stationary phase,
      Chiralpak AD-RH. Validation parameters including limit of quantification, linear 
      range, accuracy and precision were determined. The indirect separation method was
      successfully applied for the determination of enantiomeric ratio of HNEA in rat
      brain mitochondrial lysate, and showed that HNEA was formed
      (R)-enantioselectively from HNE.

TI  - Heart irradiation reduces microvascular density and accumulation of HSPA1 in
      mice.

AB  - PURPOSE: Improvement of radiotherapy techniques reduces the exposure of normal
      tissues to ionizing radiation. However, the risk of radiation-related late
      effects remains elevated. In the present study, we investigated long-term effects
      of radiation on heart muscle morphology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a 
      mouse model to study microvascular density (MVD), deposition of collagen fibers, 
      and changes in accumulation of heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 (HSPA1) in irradiated 
      heart tissue. Hearts of C57BL/6 mice received a single dose of Xray radiation in 
      the range 0.2-16 Gy. Analyses were performed 20, 40, and 60 weeks after
      irradiation. RESULTS: Reduction in MD was revealed as a long-term effect observed
      20-60 weeks after irradiation. Moreover, a significant and dose-dependent
      increase in accumulation of HSPA1, both cytoplasmic and nuclear, was observed in 
      heart tissues collected 20 weeks after irradiation. We also noticed an increase
      in collagen deposition in hearts treated with higher doses. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study shows that some changes induced by radiation in the heart tissue, such as
      reduction in microvessel density, increase in collagen deposition, and
      accumulation of HSPA1, are observed as long-term effects which might be
      associated with late radiation cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Over the last few years, genetic findings have changed our views on Parkinson's
      disease (PD), as mutations in a growing number of genes are found to cause
      monogenic forms of the disorder. Point mutations in the gene for alpha-synuclein,
      as well as duplications and triplications of the wild-type gene cause a dominant 
      form of PD in rare families, pointing towards mishandling of this protein as a
      crucial step in the molecular pathogenesis of the disorder. Mutations in the gene
      for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have recently been identified as a much 
      more common cause for dominant PD, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1,
      PINK1 and ATP13A2 all cause autosomal-recessive parkinsonism of early onset.
      Mutations in recessive genes probably are pathogenic through loss-of-function
      mechanisms, suggesting that their wild-type products protect dopaminergic cells
      against a variety of insults. Evidence is emerging that at least some of these
      genes may play a direct role in the etiology of the common sporadic form of PD.
      Further, it is likely that the cellular pathways identified in rare monogenic
      variants of the disease also shed light on the molecular pathogenesis in typical 
      sporadic PD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is a disabling non-motor symptom in Parkinson disease (PD). We
      investigated the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and fatigue in PD
      while accounting for possible confounding factors. METHODS: 29 subjects with PD
      (8F/21M; mean age 61.6+/-5.9; mean disease duration 4.8+/-3.0years), underwent
      clinical assessment and completed several non-motor symptom questionnaires,
      including a modified version of the Mayo Clinic Composite Autonomic Symptom Score
      (COMPASS) scale and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: The mean modified 
      COMPASS was 21.6+/-14.2 (range 1.7-44.2) and the mean FSS score was 3.3+/-1.6
      (range 1.0-6.7). There was a significant bivariate relationship between the
      modified COMPASS and FSS scores (R=0.69, P<0.0001). Stepwise regression analysis 
      was used to assess the specificity of the association between the modified
      COMPASS and FSS scores while accounting for possible confounder effects from
      other variables that were significantly associated with autonomic dysfunction.
      Results showed that the modified COMPASS (R(2)=0.52, F=28.4, P<0.0001) was highly
      associated with fatigue, followed by ESS (R(2)=0.13, F=8.4, P=0.008) but no other
      co-variates. Post-hoc analysis exploring the association between the different
      modified COMPASS autonomic sub-domain scores and FSS scores found significant
      regressor effects for the orthostatic intolerance (R(2)=0.45, F=21.2, P<0.0001)
      and secretomotor sub-domains (R(2)=0.09, F=4.8, P=0.04) but not for other
      autonomic sub-domains. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic dysfunction, in particular
      orthostatic intolerance, is highly associated with fatigue in PD.

TI  - In vivo small animal micro-CT using nanoparticle contrast agents.
PG  - 256
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2015.00256 [doi]
AB  - Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most valuable modalities for in vivo
      imaging because it is fast, high-resolution, cost-effective, and non-invasive.
      Moreover, CT is heavily used not only in the clinic (for both diagnostics and
      treatment planning) but also in preclinical research as micro-CT. Although CT is 
      inherently effective for lung and bone imaging, soft tissue imaging requires the 
      use of contrast agents. For small animal micro-CT, nanoparticle contrast agents
      are used in order to avoid rapid renal clearance. A variety of nanoparticles have
      been used for micro-CT imaging, but the majority of research has focused on the
      use of iodine-containing nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles. Both nanoparticle 
      types can act as highly effective blood pool contrast agents or can be targeted
      using a wide variety of targeting mechanisms. CT imaging can be further enhanced 
      by adding spectral capabilities to separate multiple co-injected nanoparticles in
      vivo. Spectral CT, using both energy-integrating and energy-resolving detectors, 
      has been used with multiple contrast agents to enable functional and molecular
      imaging. This review focuses on new developments for in vivo small animal
      micro-CT using novel nanoparticle probes applied in preclinical research.

TI  - Understanding the structure and electronic properties of molecular crystals under
      pressure: application of dispersion corrected DFT to oligoacenes.
PG  - 8323-31
LID - 10.1021/jp406573n [doi]
AB  - Oligoacenes form a fundamental class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
      which have been extensively explored for use as organic (semi) conductors in the 
      bulk phase and thin films. For this reason it is important to understand their
      electronic properties in the condensed phase. In this investigation, we use
      density functional theory with Tkatchenko-Scheffler dispersion correction to
      explore several crystalline oligoacenes (naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, and 
      pentacene) under pressures up to 25 GPa in an effort to uncover unique
      electronic/optical properties. Excellent agreement with experiment is achieved
      for the pressure dependence of the crystal structure unit cell parameters,
      densities, and intermolecular close contacts. The pressure dependence of the band
      gaps is investigated as well as the pressure induced phase transition of
      tetracene using both generalized gradient approximated and hybrid functionals. It
      is concluded that none of the oligoacenes investigated become conducting under
      elevated pressures, assuming that the molecular identity of the system is
      maintained.

TI  - Translational neuroimaging in drug addiction and obesity.
PG  - 59-68
AB  - The use of translational noninvasive neuroimaging has revealed that drug
      addiction and obesity share striking similarities in functional impairment in
      discrete brain regions and neurotransmitter circuits. Imaging experiments in both
      humans and rodents (using complementary experimental designs) show similar
      abnormalities in brain glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (involved in
      inhibitory control) and hippocampus (memory) as well as impairments in dopamine
      signaling in the striatum (involved in food and drug reward, goal orientation,
      motivation, and habit formation). In both species, many of these observations
      have been obtained through concurrent and parallel monitoring of both brain
      activity and behavioral manifestations during drug administration, food sensory
      (visual, olfactory) stimulation, and craving. This review aims to show that
      noninvasive brain imaging strategies such as small animal positron emission
      tomography offer significant potential and promise for modeling motivational
      disorders such as drug addiction and obesity in humans. Rodent addiction models
      will prove valuable for understanding brain responses to drug cues and will help 
      guide treatment, especially in relapse situations triggered by exposure to
      conditioned drug cues.

TI  - Device-related infection among patients with pacemakers and implantable
      defibrillators: incidence, risk factors, and consequences.
PG  - 786-90
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2009.01690.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Device-related infection is a major limitation of device therapy for 
      cardiac arrhythmia. METHODS: The authors analyzed the incidence and risk factors 
      for cardiac device infection (CDI) among consecutive patients implanted with
      pacemaker (PM) or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (including cardiac
      resynchronization therapy devices) at a tertiary health center in Hamilton,
      Ontario, Canada. Most patients with device-related infections were identified by 
      an internal infection control system that reports any positive wound and blood
      cultures following surgery, between 2005 and the present. A retrospective review 
      of patient records was also performed for all patients who received an ICD or PM 
      between July 1, 2003 and March 20, 2007. RESULTS: A total of 24 infections were
      identified among 2,417 patients having device surgery (1%). Fifteen of these
      infections (60%) were diagnosed within 90 days of the last surgical procedure.
      Univariate analysis showed that patients presenting with CDI were more likely to 
      have had a device replacement, rather than a new implant, had more complex
      devices (dual/triple chamber vs single), and were more likely to have had a prior
      lead dislodgement. Multivariate analysis found device replacement (P = 0.02) and 
      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)/dual-chamber devices (P = 0.048) to be
      independent predictors of infection. One patient developed septic pulmonary
      emboli after having laser-assisted lead extraction. No patient died and 22
      patients received a new device. CONCLUSION: CDI occurs in about 1% of cases in
      high volume facilities. Pulse generator replacement surgery and dual- or
      triple-chamber device implantation were associated with a significantly increased
      risk of infection.

TI  - Determinants of asthma control among children in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 435-9
LID - 10.3109/02770903.2013.876649 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. Uncontrolled
      asthma may considerably decrease the quality of life for patients and their
      families. Our objective was to identify possible risk factors for poor asthma
      control in children. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among
      children with asthma aged 4-11 years who attended a pediatric clinic for
      follow-up visits at one of the major teaching hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 
      Asthma control status was measured by the childhood asthma control test. Multiple
      logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships between
      the outcome and exposure variables. RESULTS: Uncontrolled asthma was present in
      89 out of 158 children (59.3%). Asthma control improved with the number of
      siblings. Control improved by 69% with two or three siblings (OR = 0.31, 95% CI =
      0.10-0.96) and by 87% with four or more siblings (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04-0.48).
      Similarly, asthma control improved with an increased asthma knowledge of the
      caregiver (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.81-0.93). Household incomes less than SAR 15 000
      and sharing a bedroom increased the odds of having uncontrolled asthma by 2.30
      (95% CI = 1.02-5.21) and 3.33 (95% CI = 1.33-8.35), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In
      addition to knowledge, socioeconomic factors, such as family income, household
      crowding, and the number of siblings are associated with asthma control among
      children in Saudi Arabia. Further research is needed to investigate the role of
      these factors.

TI  - Epidemiologic and Drug Resistance Pattern of Vibrio cholerae O1 Biotype El Tor,
      Serotype Ogawa, in the 2011 Cholera Outbreak, in Alborz Province, Iran.
PG  - e23477
LID - 10.5812/jjm.23477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the national guidelines recommend special antibiotics, based
      on the antibiogram of National Reference Laboratory, it seems that, because of
      uncontrolled usage of antibiotics in the society and due to the changes in the
      serotypes causing the disease, it is essential to monitor the status of drug
      resistance, permanently, and to revise the current prescriptions guidelines.
      OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the epidemiological aspects and drug
      resistance pattern of Vibrio cholerae O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, in
      cholera outbreak, in Alborz province in Iran, during 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      This is a cross-sectional study, which reviews a cholera epidemic that occurred
      in Iran. A total of 9844 specimens were taken from suspected cases, among
      diarrheal patients, via rectal swabs. The specimens were placed in Cary-Blair
      transport medium and sent to laboratory. Samples were enriched, in alkaline
      peptone water, and isolated on thiosulphate-citrate-bile salt-sucrose agar. From 
      the 244 confirmed cases, 239 cases underwent antibiogram test, via disk diffusion
      method and based on national committee for clinical laboratory standards (NCCLS) 
      instructions. The standard Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used for antibiogram
      quality control and, eventually, all results were interpreted and reported using 
      NCCLS standard table. RESULTS: In total, until October 22, 2011, which was
      announced as the end of outbreak, 9844 samples were taken from diarrheal
      patients. Regarding the type of V. cholerae, 244 El Tor biotype positive cases
      were reported. The case fatality rate was 1.3%. The mean age of patients was 37.8
      years and the highest incidence rate occurred in the age group 21 - 30 years.
      After conducting antibiotic susceptibility test in the 244 V. cholerae, biotype
      El Tor, serotype Ogawa, it was found that ciprofloxacin had the highest level of 
      antibiotic susceptibility (99.6%) and the highest level of antibiotic resistance 
      was observed in co-trimoxazole (95.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study
      show that the resistances to doxycycline and tetracycline, which are mentioned in
      multiple resources, as the most common antibiotic drugs for treating cholera, are
      increasing.

TI  - [Abdominal adipose tissue--significance and methods of detection].
PG  - 258-64
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The presence of excess fat in the abdomen, out of proportion to
      total body fat, is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and
      metabolic diseases and other complications of obesity. HISTOANATOMICAL
      CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ABDOMINAL ADIPOSE TISSUE: In regard to subcutaneous fat,
      accumulation of visceral abdominal adipose tissue is more associated with
      increased metabolic risk However, men have more visceral fat than premeno-pausal 
      women. Compared with premenopausal women, postmenopausal women have 49% more
      intra-abdominal fat, regardless of age and total fat mass. MEASUREMENT OF
      ABDOMINAL FAT DEPOTS: Various anthropometric indicators have been suggested for
      measuring body fat distribution. All of them have advantages and disadvantages,
      in relation to their interpretation and use. Many are specified as ratios and are
      difficult to interpret biologically, whereas a change in body fat distribution
      may exhibit little or no change in the ratios. Waist circumference and sagittal
      abdominal diameter are good predictors of visceral fat. But, extreme individual
      variations in visceral to subcutaneous ratio demonstrate the limitations of
      external anthropometry. The best methods to estimate the amount of visceral fat
      are imaging techniques like computed tomography or magnetic resonance, but they
      are expensive and inconvenient in routine practice. CONCLUSION: Further
      investigations should provide a simple and optimal indicator of abdominal obesity
      which should correlate with the amount of viscelar fat and the risk.

TI  - Common functional polymorphism within miR-146a and miR-196a-2 as susceptibility
      loci for hepatocellular carcinoma: An updated meta-analysis.
PG  - 40-7
LID - 10.1016/j.mgene.2015.11.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene
      region of microRNAs play an important role for the development of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Extensive studies have tried to investigate the susceptibility
      role of miR-146a rs2819164 and miR-196a-2 rs11614913. However, these results are 
      still inconsistent and inconclusive. We undertook a meta-analysis containing
      primarily Asian studies to assess the associations of the two SNPs with HCC risk.
      METHODS: 19 studies including miR-146a (7170 cases and 9443 controls) and 15
      studies including miR-196a-2 (6417 cases and 7627 controls) were used for
      meta-analysis. Odds ratios and 95% CI were calculated to assess the association
      in five different genetic models. RESULTS: For the rs2910164 polymorphism of
      miR-146a, significantly increased risks for HCC were observed when all studies
      were pooled under two models (CG vs CC: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02-1.21, P = 0.021;
      GG + CG vs CC: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01-1.22, P = 0.035). For the rs11614913
      polymorphism of miR-196a-2, significant increased risks for HCC development were 
      observed when all studies were pooled under four models (C vs T: OR = 1.14, 95%
      CI = 1.06-1.23, P = 0.001; CC vs TT: OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12-1.53, P = 0.001; CC
      + TC vs TT: OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03-1.31, P = 0.018; CC vs TC + TT: OR = 1.14,
      95% CI = 1.00-1.30, P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Our results show that the two common 
      SNPs within the miRNAs were associated with modest increased risk of HCC (OR <
      1.6), especially in the Asian population. Larger population-based studies
      validating these results are needed.

TI  - Maternal venous procalcitonin levels do not correlate with umbilical cord blood
      and venous blood concentrations in the neonate.
PG  - 462-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations between maternal blood 
      and levels in umbilical cord or venous blood of neonates who were born with or
      without infection. METHODS: Forty-six women with singleton pregnancies,
      complicated by premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery and/or
      chorioamnionitis, were enrolled in this study. The study group comprised 15
      patients and their infected newborns. The control group consisted of 31 women and
      their healthy newborns. We compared PCT concentrations between maternal,
      umbilical cord and neonatal serum, in both study and control groups.
      Additionally, PCT levels were compared between the corresponding compartments.
      RESULTS: PCT concentrations in the umbilical cord and venous blood in infected
      newborns, but not in non-infected neonates, were significantly higher than
      maternal serum PCT levels. PCT concentrations of mothers who delivered infected
      newborns were comparable to those in the controls. However, PCT concentrations in
      the umbilical cord and in the venous blood of the infected newborns were higher
      than in healthy newborns. CONCLUSION: Measurement of maternal PCT concentration
      during labor does not contribute to early prediction of infection in the neonate.
      However, umbilical cord PCT concentrations, as well as its neonatal venous levels
      on the second day of life, seem to be related to intrauterine infection, and may 
      be a useful tool in the diagnosis of early neonatal infection.

      cyanobacteria.
PG  - 613-8
LID - 10.1016/j.gde.2010.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how different cellular subsystems are coupled to each other is a
      fundamental question in the quest for reliably predicting the dynamic state of a 
      cell. Coupling of oscillatory subsystems is especially interesting as dynamic
      interactions play an important role in cell physiology. Here we review recent
      efforts that investigate and quantify the coupling between the circadian and cell
      cycle clocks in cyanobacteria as a model system. We discuss studies that quantify
      the coupling from a systems point of view in which the oscillators are described 
      in abstract terms. We also emphasize recent developments aimed at uncovering the 
      molecular details underlying the coupling between these systems. Finally we
      review recent studies that describe a potentially more overarching regulation
      scheme through global circadian regulation of DNA packing and gene expression.

TI  - Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling by epidermal growth
      factor mediates c-Jun activation and p300 recruitment in keratin 16 gene
      expression.
PG  - 85-98
AB  - In studies of gene regulation of keratin 16, we reported previously that simian
      virus 40 promoter factor 1 shows a functional cooperation with c-Jun and
      coactivators p300/CBP in driving the transcriptional regulation of epidermal
      growth factor (EGF)-induced keratin 16 gene expression. In the present study, we 
      found that the stimulated expression of keratin 16 by EGF was mediated mainly
      through the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-extracellular
      signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Ser63 and Ser73 on
      the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal transactivation domain could be phosphorylated in cells 
      treated with EGF; nevertheless, we found that the c-Jun COOH terminus played a
      pivotal role in EGF-induced expression of keratin 16. The activation of keratin
      16 by EGF treatment could not be enhanced by the overexpression of myc-c-JunK3R, 
      in which three putative acetylation lysine residues on the c-Jun COOH terminus
      were all mutated into arginines, suggesting that c-Jun acetylation on the COOH
      terminus might partially play a functional role in this system. In addition, by
      using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and a DNA affinity precipitation
      assay, EGF treatment up-regulated the p300 recruitment through ERK signaling to
      the promoter region in regulating keratin 16 transcriptional activity.
      Furthermore, the enhancement of acetyl-histone H3 to the keratin 16 chromatin
      promoter induced by EGF was also mediated via ERK activation. In conclusion,
      these results strongly suggest that both c-Jun induction and p300 recruitment to 
      gene promoter, mediated through ERK activation, played an essential role in
      regulating keratin 16 gene expression by EGF. p300 mediated and regulated
      EGF-induced keratin 16 gene expression, at least in part, through multiple
      mechanisms, including a selective acetylation of c-Jun and histone H3.

TI  - Cyclosporine treatment of anal furunculosis in 26 dogs.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of cyclosporine on anal furunculosis lesions
      in 26 dogs. METHODS: Lesions were graded as mild in 11 dogs, moderate in eight
      and severe in seven. Each dog was treated with approximately 4 mg/kg cyclosporine
      orally every 12 hours until the lesions resolved or showed no further
      improvement. Residual lesions were resected surgically. RESULTS: Eighteen dogs
      (69 per cent) experienced complete resolution, seven (27 per cent) improved but
      had residual lesions and one (4 per cent) showed no improvement. The mean
      duration of treatment until resolution or no further improvement was 8.8 weeks
      (range four to 24 weeks). Nine dogs (35 per cent) experienced recurrence. Six
      were from the group that had shown complete resolution and three were from the
      group that had surgery. Fifteen dogs (58 per cent) developed side effects to
      cyclosporine, although none required treatment to be discontinued. Mean duration 
      of follow-up was 6.8 months (range one to 20 months). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
      Cyclosporine was effective at resolving or reducing anal furunculosis lesions in 
      25 of 26 dogs (96 per cent). However, residual or recurrent lesions remain a
      potential problem, and surgical resection or long-term cyclosporine treatment may
      be necessary in some dogs.

TI  - Superior mesenteric artery syndrome: a single centre experience of laparoscopic
      duodenojejunostomy as the operation of choice.
PG  - 472-475
LID - 10.1308/rcsann.2017.0063 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, or Wilkie's syndrome,
      is a rare cause of postprandial epigastric pain, vomiting and weight loss caused 
      by compression of the third part of the duodenum as it passes beneath the
      proximal superior mesenteric artery. The syndrome may be precipitated by sudden
      weight loss secondary to other pathologies, such as trauma, malignancy or eating 
      disorders. Diagnosis is confirmed by angiography, which reveals a reduced
      aorto-SMA angle and distance, and contrast studies showing duodenal obstruction. 
      Conservative management aims to increase intra-abdominal fat by dietary
      manipulation and thereby increase the angle between the SMA and aorta. Where
      surgery is indicated, division of the ligament of Treitz, anterior transposition 
      of the third part of the duodenum and duodenojejunostomy have been described.
      METHODS We present four cases of SMA syndrome where the intention of treatment
      was laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy. The procedure was completed successfully in 
      three patients, who recovered quickly with no short-term complications. A fourth 
      patient underwent open gastrojejunostomy (complicated by an anastomotic bleed)
      when dense adhesions prevented duodenojejunostomy. CONCLUSIONS The superior
      mesenteric artery syndrome should be considered in patients with epigastric pain,
      prolonged vomiting and weight loss. Laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy is a safe and
      effective operation for management of the syndrome. A multi-speciality team
      approach including gastrointestinal, vascular and radiological specialists should
      be invoked in the management of these patients.

TI  - The role of aminopeptidase PepS in the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus is
      not restricted to nitrogen nutrition.
PG  - 148-57

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of an absence of aminopeptidase PepS on the
      growth of Streptococcus thermophilus on different media and at different
      temperatures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using gene interruption, a negative mutant of 
      the Strep. thermophilus CNRZ385 strain was constructed for the aminopeptidase
      PepS (strain DeltapepS). Checks were first of all made using biochemical assays
      that the DeltapepS strain lacks the peptide hydrolase activity of aminopeptidase 
      PepS. It was demonstrated that the absence of the aminopeptidase PepS exerted a
      negative effect on growth whatever the culture medium (M17, chemically defined
      medium, milk). The role of aminopeptidase PepS in growth was enhanced at a high
      temperature (45 degrees C vs 37 degrees C). The DeltapepS strain was more
      resistant to lysozyme than the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to
      demonstrate that aminopeptidase PepS probably plays a pleiotropic role through
      its involvement in growth via nitrogen nutrition, as well as via other cellular
      functions/metabolisms (such as peptidoglycane metabolism). SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study constitutes the first report on the role of a
      member of the M29 MEROPS family of metallopeptidases
      (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/).

TI  - Stacking multiple connecting functional materials in tandem organic
      light-emitting diodes.
PG  - 43130
LID - 10.1038/srep43130 [doi]
AB  - Tandem device is an important architecture in fabricating high performance
      organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic cells. The key element in 
      making a high performance tandem device is the connecting materials stack, which 
      plays an important role in electric field distribution, charge generation and
      charge injection. For a tandem organic light-emitting diode (OLED) with a simple 
      Liq/Al/MoO3 stack, we discovered that there is a significant current lateral
      spreading causing light emission over an extremely large area outside the OLED
      pixel when the Al thickness exceeds 2 nm. This spread light emission, caused by
      an inductive electric field over one of the device unit, limits one's ability to 
      fabricate high performance tandem devices. To resolve this issue, a new
      connecting materials stack with a C60 fullerene buffer layer is reported. This
      new structure permits optimization of the Al metal layer in the connecting stack 
      and thus enables us to fabricate an efficient tandem OLED having a high 155.6
      cd/A current efficiency and a low roll-off (or droop) in current efficiency.

TI  - Maternal health in resource-poor urban settings: how does women's autonomy
      influence the utilization of obstetric care services?
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/1742-4755-6-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite various international efforts initiated to improve maternal
      health, more than half a million women worldwide die each year as a result of
      complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth. This research was guided by 
      the following questions: 1) How does women's autonomy influence the choice of
      place of delivery in resource-poor urban settings? 2) Does its effect vary by
      household wealth? and 3) To what extent does women's autonomy mediate the
      relationship between women's education and use of health facility for delivery?
      METHODS: The data used is from a maternal health study carried out in the slums
      of Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 1,927 women (out of 2,482) who had a pregnancy
      outcome in 2004-2005 were selected and interviewed. Seventeen variable items on
      autonomy were used to construct women's decision-making, freedom of movement, and
      overall autonomy. Further, all health facilities serving the study population
      were assessed with regard to the number, training and competency of obstetric
      staff; services offered; physical infrastructure; and availability, adequacy and 
      functional status of supplies and other essential equipment for safe delivery,
      among others. A total of 25 facilities were surveyed. RESULTS: While household
      wealth, education and demographic and health covariates had strong relationships 
      with place of delivery, the effects of women's overall autonomy, decision-making 
      and freedom of movement were rather weak. Among middle to least poor households, 
      all three measures of women's autonomy were associated with place of delivery,
      and in the expected direction; whereas among the poorest women, they were strong 
      and counter-intuitive. Finally, the study showed that autonomy may not be a major
      mediator of the link between education and use of health services for delivery.
      CONCLUSION: The paper argues in favor of broad actions to increase women's
      autonomy both as an end and as a means to facilitate improved reproductive health
      outcomes. It also supports the call for more appropriate data that could further 
      support this line of action. It highlights the need for efforts to improve
      households' livelihoods and increase girls' schooling to alter perceptions of the
      value of skilled maternal health care.
